OBJECTIVE: While targeted rehabilitation can enhance hearing aid self-efficacy (HASE), little research has been done to determine the factors contributing to its predictive value. By investigating the experiences of individuals who successfully use HAs and have high levels of HASE, we hoped to illuminate specific strategies and/or sources of support these individuals share that might explain why high HASE is often linked to successful outcomes. DESIGN AND STUDY SAMPLE: This qualitative study explored the experiences of five older adults who were successful HA users and reported having high HASE. Semi-structured interview guides were developed using the transtheoretical model of behavioral change as a framework. Interviews were analyzed thematically and holistically. RESULTS: Participants attributed their HA success to: intrinsic motivation to improve their hearing, confident self-reliance when making health decisions, willingness to act on advice from trusted others, pro-social personal attributes, positive expectations about HA outcomes, and actively pursuing an optimal HA outcome. CONCLUSIONS: For these participants, internal factors related to emotional state and source of motivation, and, to a lesser extent, verbal persuasion played a crucial role in their long-term success. This suggests that external influencers might be less impactful in facilitating success for those with high HASE. DOI: 10.1080/14992027.2023.2243541 PMID: 37607212  7.

INTRODUCTION: In recent years, it has been described that the dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota plays a transcendental role in several pathologies. In this sense, the importance of the gut microbiota in the gut-brain axis, with a bidirectional communication, has been demonstrated. Furthermore, the gut microbiota has been linked with mood disorders and neuropsychiatric disorders. METHODS: A systematic review of two databases - PubMed and Scopus - was carried out following PRISMA guidelines. We included original studies in humans with a control group published in the last 11?years, which were assessed by the Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) to confirm their quality. Eighteen articles met all the selection criteria. RESULTS: A review of the articles revealed an association between psychiatric disorders and different bacterial phyla. The studies we have reviewed have demonstrated differences between subjects with psychiatric disorders and controls and highlight a clear relationship between depression, stress, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), psychotic episodes, eating disorders, anxiety and brain function and the gut microbiota composition. CONCLUSION: A reduction of fermentative taxa has been observed in different psychiatric disorders, resulting in a decrease in the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and an increase in pro-inflammatory taxa, both of which may be consequences of the exacerbation of these pathologies.

Bipolar disorder (BD) is a highly prevalent condition whose response to pharmacological treatment is associated with a number of factors including psychiatric comorbidity. Borderline personality disorder (BPD) shares clinical symptoms and biological vulnerability with BD and the two conditions are frequently comorbid, thus representing a clinical challenge. The purpose of the present review is to summarize the data related to treatment response in bipolar patients with comorbid BPD. According to systematic review process, a literature search was performed on the PubMed, Embase, PsycInfo, Isi Web of Knowledge, Medscape, and Cochrane Library databases. Peer-reviewed articles until December 2022 were eligible for inclusion. Comorbidity with BPD seems to be associated with a more difficult clinical stabilization in bipolar patients, often requiring poly-therapy or a longer duration of hospitalization. However, three studies, assessing the effectiveness of mood stabilizers in bipolar patients, did not demonstrate a prominent influence of BPD comorbidity in achieving clinical response. The most frequently administered pharmacological treatments in the selected studies include mood stabilizers and atypical antipsychotics. The presence of comorbid BPD in bipolar patients may hamper treatment effectiveness. Future studies, comparing different treatments and with larger samples, are needed to confirm the results critically summarized in the present review. Copyright © 2023 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

INTRODUCTION: According to the literature, early initiation to cannabis use and a dependent pattern of use are important risk factors for the development of mental health disorders. However, there are few cohort studies which look at the development of mental health disorders associated with cannabis use among young people with cannabis use disorder (CUD). The aim of the study was to determine the cumulative incidence of mental health disorders and the risk of developing mental health disorders among minors who commenced treatment for CUD in Catalonia during 2015-2019. METHODS: This was a retrospective fixed cohort study, matched for confounding variables, based on data from the Catalan Health Surveillance System. The exposed cohort comprised young people who entered treatment for CUD during 2015-2019 (n = 948) and who were minors on the date of commencing treatment. Matching was done with a paired cohort (n = 4,737), according to confounding variables. Individuals with a diagnosis of a mental health disorder prior to the study period were excluded. The cumulative incidence was calculated for mental health disorders for the exposed and the paired cohorts and stratified by type of mental disorder. Incidence rate ratios were estimated using the conditional Poisson model with robust variance, stratified by sex. RESULTS: The cumulative incidence for development of a mental health disorder was 19.6% in the exposed cohort and 3.1% in the paired cohort; with higher incidence among females (females 32.7%; males 15.8%). The exposed cohort had an 8.7 times increased risk of developing a mental health disorder than the paired cohort. The most frequent diagnoses were reaction to severe stress, adjustment disorder, and personality disorders. CONCLUSION: This study confirmed that the exposed cohort was at increased risk of developing mental health disorders compared to the paired cohort. To date, few studies have analyzed the association between cannabis use and the development of mental health disorders, considering cannabis dependence. Further studies should be undertaken considering CUD. In addition, more studies are needed to understand the factors that determine the development of CUD. Further research in these areas would contribute to the design of prevention strategies aimed at those young individuals with a higher risk of developing cannabis dependence and suffering its consequences. © 2023 The Author(s).

INTRODUCTION: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a complex mental disorder with core symptoms like interpersonal instability, emotion dysregulation, self-harm, and impulsive decision-making. Previous neuropsychological studies have found impairment in the decision-making of patients with BPD related to impulsivity. In our study, we focus on a better, more nuanced understanding of impulsive decision-making in BPD with the help of Rogers' decision-making test that simulates a gambling situation. METHODS: A novelty of our study is that we excluded from further analysis non-compliant participants based on their performance. Outlier participants on the measures proportion of good choices and average of wager choice number were filtered out to represent the population that understood the basic premise of the task and showed minimal motivation to gain rewards. Thus participants often choosing the less likely color or frequently choosing the first bet amount available (to probably speed up the test) were omitted from further analysis. Another novelty is that we assessed and reported six variables that examine Deliberation Time, Quality of Decision, Risk-taking, Overall proportion bet, Delay aversion, and Risk adjustment. Forty-three women with BPD participated in the study, and 16 non-compliant were excluded. As for the healthy control group, 42 women participated in the study, and four non-compliant were excluded. Thus, we compared the data of 27 patients with BPD with 38 healthy controls. RESULTS: Our results show that there are significant differences amongst the groups regarding the Quality of Decision Making (F (1,63)?=?5.801, p?=?0.019) and Risk Adjustment (F (1,63)?=?6.522, p?=?0.013). We also found significant interactions between group and winning probability regarding Risk Taking (F (4,252)?=?4.765 p?=?0.001) and Overall proportion of bets, i.e., the average proportion of bets relative to the total score of the subject (F (4,252)?=?4.505, p?=?0.002). DISCUSSION: Our results show that the two groups use different decision-making strategies that can have various associations with everyday life situations.

RATIONALE: Clozapine is a unique medication with a potential role in the treatment of severe borderline personality disorder (BPD). OBJECTIVES: The review examines the effectiveness of clozapine as a medication for management for severe BPD with high risk of suicide, violence or imprisonment, and aims to help guide clinical practice in managing severe BPD. METHODS: A database search of the terms ""Clozapine"" AND ""BPD""; ""Antipsychotics"" AND ""BPD""; ""Clozapine"" AND ""Borderline Personality Disorder""; and ""Antipsychotics"" AND ""Borderline Personality Disorder"" were performed in CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Embase, Medline, PsychINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science. Full-text articles of clinical clozapine use for BPD were included for review. RESULTS: A total of 24 articles consisting of 1 randomised control trial, 10 non-controlled trials, and 13 case reports were identified. Most of the studies reported benefits from clozapine when used for severe BPD. Many of the studies focused on clozapine use in BPD patients at high risk of suicide. Results from these non-controlled and case reports support the use of clozapine in patients with severe BPD at high risk of suicide. CONCLUSION: There may be a role for clozapine in treating severe treatment refractory BPD, especially for those patients at high risk of suicide and frequent hospitalisations. © 2023. Crown.

BACKGROUND: Individuals with leprosy are at risk of leprosy reactions, T-cell mediated immunological complications, which lead to nerve function impairment. Leprosy reactions require systemic immunosuppression which is a risk factor for severe COVID-19. Vaccination for SARS-CoV-2 infection is recommended in the UK and became widely available in 2021 with individuals at increased risk of severe disease, including the immunosuppressed, prioritised. Vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 may provoke a T cell response. The latter poses a theoretical risk of provoking an immunological response to latent Mycobacterium leprae infection leading to clinical disease or in those with clinical disease triggering a leprosy reaction. BCG vaccination is associated with the development of leprosy in a small proportion of healthy contacts of people with leprosy within twelve weeks of administration. BCG causes a Th1 immune response. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We performed a retrospective cohort study to determine the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination status of individuals diagnosed with leprosy attending the Leprosy Clinic in 2021 and whether any had developed leprosy or experienced a new leprosy reaction within twelve weeks of receiving a dose of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. The electronic patient records were used to retrieve data. Fifty-two individuals with leprosy attended the clinic in 2021 of which five people were newly diagnosed with leprosy. Thirty-seven (71%) were male and the median age was 48.5 years old (Range 27-85 years). Eight (15.4%) individuals were taking multi-drug therapy (MDT) and eight (15.4%) had completed MDT within three years of the study. Twenty-two (41.5%) individuals were prescribed a systemic immunosuppressant drug during 2021. Ten (18.9%) individuals have one or more risk factors for severe COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 vaccination status of fifty (96%) were recorded of which forty-nine were vaccinated (98%). One individual had declined vaccination. One individual was diagnosed with borderline tuberculoid (BT) leprosy having developed red skin lesions with reduced sensation (which increased in size and number) and thickened peripheral nerves one week after a second dose of BNT162b2 vaccine. Another individual who had completed MDT more than three years earlier developed red plaques and tender thickened nerves consistent with a leprosy Type 1 reaction eight weeks after a single dose of BNT162b2 vaccine (having received two doses of CoronaVac vaccine three months earlier). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The development of BT leprosy and a Type 1 reaction in another individual shortly after a dose of BNT162b2 vaccine may be associated with vaccine mediated T cell responses. The benefits of vaccination to reduce the risk of severe COVID-19 outweigh these unwanted events but data from leprosy endemic countries may provide further information about potential adverse effects of augmented T cell responses in individuals with leprosy or latent M. leprae infection.

At a closer look, however, previous research identified types of problem gamblers and not of problem gambling. While correct typologies of gamblers are important for developing treatment, they are less useful for harm prevention. The current study uses a system theoretical approach to investigate gambling communication in order to develop a genuine typology of gambling. Snowball sampling of Finnish gamblers resulted in 56 participants, who wrote 48 narratives about their ordinary gambling, 43 narratives about their most remarkable gambling event, and 28 about their worst gambling experience. The approach is informed by systems theory: communication on gambling is understood as a result of the reduction of contingency. Rather than focusing on the meaning of gambling or why people gamble, the analysis investigates what is included and what is excluded to make gambling discussable, i.e., the contextures of gambling. Economic and family/intimate contexture were the most prominent. The latter appeared most often in the most memorable gambling experiences. The economic contexture was more common in narrating ordinary and worst gambling situations. In all, four types of gambling could be identified: genuine monetary gambling, resonating monetary gambling, commensal gambling, and liminal gambling. When comparing the previously identified types of gamblers with the types of gambling discovered in the present study, it becomes obvious that a shift from the gamblers, their background, their personality, and their motives to the gambling activity provides novel insights. The constant appearance of the familial/intimate dimension in the narratives indicates that, beside the financial harms, societal harms also need to be treated as a category of harm in its own right, not just as a consequence of personality disorders, psychological distress, or social deprivation.

BACKGROUND: The AT(N) research framework for Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unclear on how to best deal with borderline cases. Our aim was to characterise patients with suspected AD with a borderline Aß1-42/Aß1-40 ratio in cerebrospinal fluid. METHODS: We analysed retrospective data from two cohorts (memory clinic cohort and ADNI) of patients (n?=?63) with an Aß1-42/Aß1-40 ratio within a predefined borderline area-Q1 above the validated cut-off value(grey zone). We compared demographic, clinical, neuropsychological and neuroimaging features between grey zone patients and patients with low Aß1-42 (normal Aß ratio but pathological Aß1-42, n?=?42) and patients with AD (pathological Aß, P-Tau, und T-Tau, n?=?80). RESULTS: Patients had mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia and a median age of 72 years. Demographic and general clinical characteristics did not differ between the groups. Patients in the grey zone group were the least impaired in cognition. However, they overlapped with the low Aß1-42 group in verbal episodic memory performance, especially in delayed recall and recognition. The grey zone group had less severe medial temporal atrophy, but mild posterior atrophy and mild white matter hyperintensities, similar to the low Aß1-42 group. CONCLUSIONS: Patients in the Aß ratio grey zone were less impaired, but showed clinical overlap with patients on the AD continuum. These borderline patients may be at an earlier disease stage. Assuming an increased risk of AD and progressive cognitive decline, careful consideration of clinical follow-up is recommended when using dichotomous approaches to classify Aß status. © 2023.

INTRODUCTION: To gain insights into the mechanisms underlying distinct nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) histological phenotypes between children and adults, we compared hepatic gene expression profiles associated with NAFLD phenotypes between the two age groups. METHODS: Histological characteristics of intra-operative liver biopsies from adolescents and adults undergoing bariatric surgery were assessed by the same pathologist using the non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) Clinical Research Network scoring system. Hepatic gene expression was measured by microarray analysis. Transcriptomic signatures of histological phenotypes between the two groups were compared, with significance defined as p-value <0.05 and a fold change >1.5. RESULTS: In 67 adolescents and 76 adults, distribution of histological phenotypes was: not-NAFLD (controls) 51% vs 39%, NAFL 39% vs 37%, and NASH 10% vs 24%, respectively. There were 279 differentially expressed genes in adolescents and 213 in adults with NAFLD vs controls. In adolescents, transcriptomes for NAFL vs controls, and borderline vs definite NASH were undifferentiable, whereas in adults, NAFL and borderline NASH demonstrated a transcriptomic gradient between controls and definite NASH. When applied to adolescents, significant adult genes discriminated borderline and definite NASH from control and NAFL, but the majority of significant pediatric genes were not portable to adults. Genes associated with NASH in adolescents and adults showed some ontological consistency but notable differences. CONCLUSIONS: There is some similarity but major differences in the transcriptomic profiles associated with NAFLD between adolescents and adults with severe obesity. These data suggest different mechanisms contribute to the pathogenesis of NAFLD severity at different stages in life. DOI: 10.26502/acbr.50170323 PMCID: PMC10426795 PMID: 37583647  23.

The physical and psychological factors which contributed to the occurrence and relation of both conditions are yet to be determined. OBJECTIVES: The personality traits, coping styles and psychological distress of young adults with temporomandibular disorder (TMD) and somatic symptoms were characterized together with the determination of psychological risk factors for TMDs, somatization and combined conditions. METHODS: Participants were recruited from university-attending young adults. TMD and somatic symptoms were appraised with the short-form Fonseca Anamnestic Index and Patient Health Questionnaire-15. Psychological variables were assessed with the Big Five Personality Inventory-10, Brief-COPE Inventory and Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales-21. Data were evaluated using chi-squared/non-parametric tests and logistic regression analyses (??=?.05). RESULTS: Among the 507 participants (mean age 22.2?±?1.5?years), 46.4% reported no TMD/somatic symptoms (NS) while 7.5%, 34.5% and 11.6% had TMDs only (TS), somatization only (SS) and combined TMDs-somatization (CS), respectively. Significant differences in conscientiousness (NS?>?SS), agreeableness (NS, TS?>?CS; NS?>?SS), dysfunctional coping, general distress, depression, anxiety and stress (CS???SS?>?NS) were discerned. Multivariate analyses indicated that the odds of TS were increased by anxiety (OR?=?1.10; 95% CI?=?1.01-1.21), while the odds of SS/CS were affected by anxiety (OR?=?1.15; 95% CI?=?1.06-1.25/OR?=?1.34; 95% CI?=?0.19-1.52) and problem-focused coping (OR?=?0.71; 95% CI?=?0.56-0.89/OR?=?0.55; 95% CI?=?0.39-0.78). CONCLUSION: Though individuals with TMDs and somatization have dissimilar psychological profiles, anxiety constantly increased their likelihood. Problem-focused coping strategies may help alleviate psychosocial and physical stressors associated with TMDs and somatization. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Competing models suggest that physical pain may play an important role in nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) via pain onset or pain offset, or that pain may be absent (analgesia). Few studies have tested these models in the same sample or examined factors that could explain differences in NSSI pain experience. We assessed 1,630 individuals with NSSI histories in an online survey. We descriptively examined pain during NSSI and tested preregistered hypotheses that NSSI frequency, NSSI severity, borderline personality disorder (BPD) features, emotional pain, and dissociation during NSSI are associated with experiencing less NSSI pain. Exploratorily, we also tested whether self-punishment motives were associated with less NSSI pain. Almost all participants reported recent and frequent NSSI. Participants were heterogenous in their report of NSSI pain. We found minimal support for analgesia (reported by only 4.3% of participants). More participants reported pain onset than offset, but offset was associated with reductions in emotional pain. Emotional pain was elevated prior to NSSI and decreased significantly during and after NSSI. We found that higher dissociation during NSSI was associated with less NSSI pain. Contrary to hypotheses, NSSI severity, emotional pain prior to NSSI, and self-punishment motives were associated with greater NSSI pain. NSSI frequency and BPD features were not associated with NSSI pain. BPD features interacted with dissociation and emotional pain prior to NSSI. Findings contrast with laboratory pain induction work, suggesting that, though people who self-harm may have heightened pain tolerance, they may seek to self-injure in a manner that results in pain.

(#)Contributed equally The risk factors for breast cancer have been defined in several studies but there is deficient data for specific subtypes. We report here the pathological characteristics of a breast cancer cohort and risk factors for patients with triple-negative disease. In this case-control study, a prospective breast cancer cohort was evaluated for demographic, reproductive, obesity-related and other risk factors using a validated questionnaire. Tumors were characterized for routine pathological characteristics and immunohistochemical markers of basal-like breast cancer. Patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) constituted cases and those with non-TNBC were controls. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated for each risk factor and independent associations were tested in an unconditional logistic regression analysis. Between 2011 and 2014, 1146 patients were recruited, of whom 912 [TNBC 266 (29.1%), non-TNBC 646 (70.9%)] with sufficient pathology material were analysed. Reproductive factors of parity, breastfeeding, age-at-menarche, age at first full-term pregnancy and oral contraceptive use were not significantly associated with TNBC. Higher body mass index (BMI?>?24.9 vs???24.9, OR 0.89, 95%CI 0.63-1.24, p?=?0.49) was not significantly associated while lesser waist circumference (>?80 cm vs???80 cm, OR 0.64, 95%CI 0.45-0.9, p?=?0.012) and lower waist-to-hip ratio were significantly associated (>?0.85 vs???0.85, OR 0.72, 95%CI 0.51-1.0, p?=?0.056), with TNBC. History of tobacco use was not significantly associated while lower socio-economic status was borderline associated with TNBC (socio-economic category?>?5 versus???5, OR 0.73, 95%CI 0.50-1.06, p?=?0.106). No factor was significant after adjustment for covariates. Central obesity seems to be preferentially associated with non-TNBC, and lower socio-economic status with TNBC in India, while most other conventional risk factors of breast cancer show no significant association with TNBC versus non-TNBC. © 2023.

Personality disorders (PDs) are associated with high levels of societal costs, regardless of whether a single PD or a broad range of PDs have been studied. However, research on the relative contribution of specific PD-types on societal costs is limited. The aim of this study was to explore the possible contributions of the individual DSM-5 categories of PDs on the level of societal costs and its components (health service costs and productivity loss), while controlling for the impact of comorbid mental health and substance use disorders on these outcomes. Participants (n?=?798) were retrieved from the quality register of the Norwegian Network for Personality Disorders-a collaboration of PD-treatment units within specialist mental health services. The patients were referred to treatment in the time-period 2017-2020. Costs were assessed using a structured interview covering the 6-month period prior to assessment. Diagnoses were determined by semi-structured diagnostic interviews (SCID-5-PD and M.I.N.I.). Statistics included multiple regression analyses. The main result was that no specific PD had a unique contribution to the high level of societal costs generally found among treatment-seeking patients with PDs. Borderline PD (BPD) was the only PD with significantly higher health service costs than the other PDs, while BPD, avoidant PD, and unspecified PD were independently associated with enhanced productivity loss. The differential cost-effects of specific PDs on the cost components were small. Several comorbid mental health and substance use disorders were significant contributors to costs, irrespective of PD status. The results underscore the importance of developing and implementing effective treatments for a broader range of PDs, to reduce the high levels of societal costs associated with all PDs. © 2023.

However, the details of long-term follow-up cases have not been reported. In this report, a 19-year-old patient presented with a stage IIIC serous borderline tumor. The patient underwent five fertility-sparing surgeries. The tumor did not respond to any of the three lines of chemotherapy administered. Serological and radiological responses were observed following hormonal treatment with leuprorelin, followed by a fourth surgery. Before the planned fifth surgery for complete resection of both adnexa, cryopreservation of the fertilized eggs was performed. At age 36, when the disease-free interval exceeded the previous one, we proposed embryo transfer; however, she declined fertility treatment. The patient had developed rheumatoid arthritis and childbirth not a priority. The patient had lived without any evidence of disease for 7?years following the last surgery and 20?years after the initial visit. © 2023 Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology.

Handedness is a core phenotype in clinical laterality research and several different disorders such as schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders have been linked to a higher prevalence of non-right-handedness. Moreover, subclinical personality traits like schizotypy have been linked to a higher prevalence of non-right-handedness. The association with handedness is poorly understood for generalized anxiety disorder and specific phobias, as well as for state and trait anxiety and fear of specific stimuli in nonclinical samples. Therefore, we performed a narrative review of studies investigating handedness in anxiety disorders patients and studies that compared anxiety scores between different handedness groups. Unlike schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders, there seems to be no strong association between anxiety disorders and handedness in adult patients, except for specific phobias. Studies often had small sample sizes and therefore a high risk to report spurious findings. Similar findings were reported in most non-clinical studies. Importantly, familial handedness affects phobia risk and antenatal maternal anxiety increased the probability of mixed-handedness. This suggests that a transgenerational, developmental perspective is essential to better understand the complex interrelations between handedness and anxiety. Familial and especially maternal handedness and anxiety disorders should be integrated into future studies on handedness and anxiety whenever possible.

Aripiprazole is an atypical antipsychotic medication, and its use in treating borderline personality disorder (BPD) is debatable because it is not FDA-approved for treating BPD. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of aripiprazole in patients with BPD. On July 2, 2021, the protocol (CRD42021256647) was registered in PROSPERO. PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Ovid-Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and Cochrane (CENTRAL) were searched without regard for language or publication date. We also searched trial registries on ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. Randomized clinical trials with adult patients diagnosed with BPD met the inclusion criteria. The Cochrane risk of bias for randomized trials (RoB-2) method was used to assess the quality of the included studies. We included two previously published randomized clinical trials. There were 76 patients with BPD, with 38, 12, and 26 assigned to the aripiprazole, olanzapine, and placebo groups, respectively. Most patients (88.16%) were females, with ages ranging from 22.1 to 28.14 yr. Aripiprazole has been proven to reduce anxiety, depression, anger, hostility, clinical severity, and obsessive-compulsive behavior, insecurity, melancholy, anxiety, aggressiveness/hostility, phobic anxiety, paranoid thinking, psychoticism, and somatization. The adverse effects were headache, insomnia, restlessness, tremor, and akathisia. The risk of bias was considerable in both trials, which is somewhat problematic considering that prejudice can lead to incorrect outcomes and conclusions. Aripiprazole has demonstrated encouraging outcomes in the treatment of patients with BPD. More randomized controlled studies are needed. © 2023.

At a closer look, however, previous research identified types of problem gamblers and not of problem gambling. While correct typologies of gamblers are important for developing treatment, they are less useful for harm prevention. The current study uses a system theoretical approach to investigate gambling communication in order to develop a genuine typology of gambling. Snowball sampling of Finnish gamblers resulted in 56 participants, who wrote 48 narratives about their ordinary gambling, 43 narratives about their most remarkable gambling event, and 28 about their worst gambling experience. The approach is informed by systems theory: communication on gambling is understood as a result of the reduction of contingency. Rather than focusing on the meaning of gambling or why people gamble, the analysis investigates what is included and what is excluded to make gambling discussable, i.e., the contextures of gambling. Economic and family/intimate contexture were the most prominent. The latter appeared most often in the most memorable gambling experiences. The economic contexture was more common in narrating ordinary and worst gambling situations. In all, four types of gambling could be identified: genuine monetary gambling, resonating monetary gambling, commensal gambling, and liminal gambling. When comparing the previously identified types of gamblers with the types of gambling discovered in the present study, it becomes obvious that a shift from the gamblers, their background, their personality, and their motives to the gambling activity provides novel insights. The constant appearance of the familial/intimate dimension in the narratives indicates that, beside the financial harms, societal harms also need to be treated as a category of harm in its own right, not just as a consequence of personality disorders, psychological distress, or social deprivation.

The Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP) is a phenotypic data-driven framework for the classification of psychopathology. We tested the construct and criterion validity of the HiTOP spectra measured by the Personality Inventory for DSM-5 (PID-5) using exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM) and hierarchical regressions both to predict somatic symptom and related disorders (SSRD) and a somatization factor. The case-control study used hierarchical logistic regressions to distinguish 257 cases with SSRD from 1007 healthy controls by both the maladaptive and the temperament factors. The extracted factors were also used in hierarchical linear regressions to predict the dimensional somatization factor. The seven temperament factors explained more variance above and beyond the five maladaptive factors when predicting SSRD (pseudo R2?=?0.169 to 0.266 versus 0.125 to 0.196; change in pseudo R2?=?0.055 to 0.087 versus 0.011 to 0.017). The temperament factors also explained more variance above and beyond the maladaptive factors when predicting the somatization factor (R2?=?0.392 versus 0.269; change in R2?=?0.146 versus 0.023). Although the HiTOP spectra measured by PID-5 are significant structures related to the categorical and dimensional measurements of somatoform, our findings highlight potential problems with both the construct and criterion validity of the HiTOP spectra. © 2023.

Existing literature on the effects of borderline personality disorder (BPD) and eating disorder (ED) comorbidity in terms of clinical presentation and treatment outcome has been limited and inconclusive. The present study examined whether clients with EDs and varying levels of BPD symptoms presented with more severe ED symptoms at admission, and whether they responded to dialectical behavior therapy (DBT)-based treatment. Participants (N = 176) were adults in a DBT-based partial hospitalization program for EDs at an academic medical center. Participants completed self-report measures at admission, 1-month postadmission, discharge, and 6-month follow-up. Results suggested that patients with elevated BPD symptoms at admission had greater ED symptoms during treatment, evidenced by small to moderate effect sizes. However, patients with high BPD symptoms demonstrated steeper declines in binge eating, fasting, and parasuicidal behavior early during treatment compared to patients with low BPD symptoms. Individuals with high BPD symptoms at admission (i.e., probable BPD diagnosis) were as likely to meet remission criteria and relapse as individuals with low BPD symptoms, though this null finding may be influenced by small cell sizes. Our findings also suggest that DBT skills use does not predict changes in symptoms. In sum, our findings suggest that while clients with higher BPD symptoms may improve during DBT-based partial hospitalization, their ED symptoms may remain more severe. Future studies are needed to determine whether adjunctive treatments improve outcomes for clients with EDs and comorbid BPD symptoms in DBT programs and whether skills use quality is a better predictor of ED symptom changes.

Reduction in food intake is an important feature of eating disorders (EDs). However, whereas self-reported cognitive control over food (i.e., dietary restraint) is commonly assessed, we are not aware of any study evaluating the actual reduction in caloric intake (i.e., caloric restriction, CR) and its relationships with psychopathological, clinical, and anamnestic factors in individuals with EDs. In this study, we quantified caloric intake, CR, and weight suppression in 225 ED inpatients and explored significant relationships with self-reported eating symptoms, body dissatisfaction, body avoidance, personality, and affective symptoms. For underweight inpatients (n = 192), baseline predictors of caloric intake and restriction at discharge were assessed through a data-driven approach. CR at admission was significantly related to eating symptomatology, state anxiety, and body image. In regression models, CR, higher BMI, binge-purging symptoms, and the interaction between weight suppression and CR were significantly related to body dissatisfaction. The best psychopathological predictors of caloric intake and restriction at discharge for underweight inpatients were perfectionistic concern over mistakes and state anxiety.

BACKGROUND: Early detection and intervention of borderline personality disorder (BPD) in adolescence has become a public health priority. Theoretical models emphasize the role of social interactions and transgenerational mechanisms in the development of the disorder suggesting a closer look at caregiver-child relationships. METHODS: The current study investigated mother-adolescent interactions and their association with adolescent BPD traits by using a case-control design. Thirty-eight adolescent patients with???3 BPD traits and their mothers (BPD-G) were investigated in contrast to 35 healthy control dyads (HC-G). Maternal, adolescent and dyadic behavior was coded using the Coding Interactive Behavior Manual (CIB) during two interactions: a fun day planning and a stress paradigm. Additional effects of maternal and/or adolescent early life maltreatment (ELM) on behavior were also explored. RESULTS: BPD-G displayed a significantly lower quality of maternal, adolescent and dyadic behavior than the HC-G during both interactions. Maternal and adolescent behavior was predicted by BPD traits alone, whilst dyadic behavior was also influenced by general adolescent psychopathology. Exploratory analyses of CIB subscales showed that whilst HC-G increased their reciprocal behavior during stress compared to the fun day planning, BPD-G dyads decreased it. Maternal ELM did not differ between groups or have any effect on behavior. Adolescent ELM was correlated with behavioral outcome variables, but did not explain behavioral outcomes above and beyond the effect of clinical status. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Our data suggest a stronger focus on parent-child interactions in BPD-specific therapies to enhance long-term treatment outcomes in adolescent BPD patients. Further research employing study designs that allow the analyses of bidirectional transactions (e.g. longitudinal design, behavioral microcoding) is needed. © 2023.

Objective: The Personality Inventory for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (PID-5), is a trait-based measure of pathological personality designed to assess Criterion B of an alternative diagnostic system for personality disorders (PDs). In this study, we aimed to evaluate the relations among the PID-5 and the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2-Restructured Form (MMPI-2-RF); a commonly used self-report instrument with a hierarchical structure. Method : We examined the joint structure of the PID-5 scales along with levels of the MMPI-2-RF hierarchy to understand whether conceptually expected structures tend to be loaded with each other. Data were collected from 536 participants from the general population of Iran. Results: Findings of Pearson's correlation analyses exhibited the generally expected patterns between the two mentioned measures on most scales, with some divergences. Similarly, although applying a set of joint exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM) exhibited some factor loadings for PID-5 facets within the hierarchical framework of MMPI-2-RF scales that were different to what was theoretically expected, both measures were generally loaded in a conceptually expected way, indicating that they have a similar dimensional structure. Conclusion: Our findings provide support for adequate convergence of maladaptive personality traits and psychopathology structures, as well as for utilizing MMPI-2-RF to measure personality psychopathology from a dimensional perspective. The implications of these results are discussed by the authors. Copyright © 2023 Tehran University of Medical Sciences. Published by Tehran University of Medical Sciences.

BACKGROUND: This study focused on the impact of therapeutic alliance on therapy dropout in a naturalistic sample of patients with borderline pathology receiving dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) in a residential setting. We assumed that low therapeutic alliance shortly after admission would be associated with elevated dropout. METHODS: 44 participants with borderline pathology (??3 DSM-5 borderline personality disorder criteria) in a residential DBT program completed a quality assurance questionnaire set assessing demographic information, pretreatment psychopathology and therapeutic alliance during the first seven days of their residential stay. Predictors of dropout were investigated using binary logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: The dropout rate was 34.1% (n?=?15). In binary logistic regression analyses with variables covering demographic and clinical characteristics, comorbidities and childhood trauma history, only the therapeutic alliance significantly predicted dropout (z = -2.371, p?=?.018). CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the importance of therapy process variables, here the therapeutic alliance at the beginning of treatment, as predictors of therapy dropout in borderline pathology. If this finding is replicated, it shows the potential importance of monitoring the therapeutic relationship throughout the therapeutic process.

OBJECTIVE: The schema mode model offers a new conceptualisation of complex dissociative disorders (CDD) as it explains shifts between identities as shifts between schema modes. Furthermore, in this model CDD is conceived as personality pathology, incorporating core features of personality disorders. This study tested the assumptions of this schema mode model of CDD. METHOD: Questionnaires measuring personality disorder traits, schemas, schema modes and coping styles were filled out by patients with CDD, borderline personality disorder and avoidant personality disorder (N?=?210), and their scores on the various constructs were compared. RESULTS: Participants with CDD were characterised by specific schizoid, schizotypal, borderline and avoidant personality traits and early maladaptive schemas in the domains of disconnection and rejection and over-vigilance and inhibition. The most pronounced schema modes were the dysfunctional parent modes, avoidant coping modes and the vulnerable child mode. For coping styles, no differences were found between the diagnostic groups. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION: On all outcome measures participants with CDD scored at the level of personality disorders and showed a unique pattern different from participants with borderline and avoidant personality disorder. This suggests that CDD shows features akin to a personality disorder. A clinical implication is that an adapted form of schema therapy might present a viable treatment option for CDD. © 2023 The Authors.

Good Psychiatric Management (GPM) is a generalist clinical management approach for borderline personality disorder that incorporates common ingredients of good standard care for any psychiatric diagnosis with what works from prevailing specialist psychotherapies. Similar to all validated therapies for BPD, it relies on a specified formulation of the disorder' symptoms as arising from interpersonal hypersensitivity, to dynamically describe typical patterns of daily self- and interpersonal issues that drive the instability that defines the general personality dysfunction characteristic of the disorder. Recent adaptations of GPM have been proposed for narcissistic personality disorder and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, with development of similar dynamic models for both (intrapsychic coherence model and model of overcontrol). New dimensional models of personality disorder diagnosis have been developed to address limitations of categorical approach, but the incorporation of these models into usage in the delivery of clinical services (where categorical approach remains the most used) is limited. This paper describes an adaptation of GPM to two cases of personality disorder that illustrate the usefulness of GPM models for dynamic representation of complex daily fluctuations in internal psychic coherence and interpersonal functioning. Specialist psychotherapies will never meet the demands of public health needs to treat personality dysfunction, and incorporation of new dimensional models of diagnosis are needed for treatments that can provide a minimal standard of care for providers and patients.

The physical and psychological factors which contributed to the occurrence and relation of both conditions are yet to be determined. OBJECTIVES: The personality traits, coping styles and psychological distress of young adults with temporomandibular disorder (TMD) and somatic symptoms were characterized together with the determination of psychological risk factors for TMDs, somatization and combined conditions. METHODS: Participants were recruited from university-attending young adults. TMD and somatic symptoms were appraised with the short-form Fonseca Anamnestic Index and Patient Health Questionnaire-15. Psychological variables were assessed with the Big Five Personality Inventory-10, Brief-COPE Inventory and Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales-21. Data were evaluated using chi-squared/non-parametric tests and logistic regression analyses (??=?.05). RESULTS: Among the 507 participants (mean age 22.2?±?1.5?years), 46.4% reported no TMD/somatic symptoms (NS) while 7.5%, 34.5% and 11.6% had TMDs only (TS), somatization only (SS) and combined TMDs-somatization (CS), respectively. Significant differences in conscientiousness (NS?>?SS), agreeableness (NS, TS?>?CS; NS?>?SS), dysfunctional coping, general distress, depression, anxiety and stress (CS???SS?>?NS) were discerned. Multivariate analyses indicated that the odds of TS were increased by anxiety (OR?=?1.10; 95% CI?=?1.01-1.21), while the odds of SS/CS were affected by anxiety (OR?=?1.15; 95% CI?=?1.06-1.25/OR?=?1.34; 95% CI?=?0.19-1.52) and problem-focused coping (OR?=?0.71; 95% CI?=?0.56-0.89/OR?=?0.55; 95% CI?=?0.39-0.78). CONCLUSION: Though individuals with TMDs and somatization have dissimilar psychological profiles, anxiety constantly increased their likelihood. Problem-focused coping strategies may help alleviate psychosocial and physical stressors associated with TMDs and somatization. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

BACKGROUND: Sex differences in the prevalence and clinical features of depression have been widely described. However, some authors argue that categorical diagnostic systems do not adequately capture the complexity of depression. The aim of this study was to examine sex differences in the symptom network structure of depressive symptoms among individuals with a major depressive episode. METHODS: The study sample consisted of 510 participants (age 62.17 ± 14.43, 71.96 % women) from a nationwide study of the Spanish non-institutionalised adult population (Edad con Salud). To estimate the presence of a 12-month major depressive episode according to DSM-IV criteria, participants were administered an adapted version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI 3.0). A network analysis was carried out to determine possible interrelationships between different depressive symptoms by sex. RESULTS: Men and women showed a similar overall structure and network strength. However, sex-specific variations emerged in relation to individual symptom associations and symptom centrality. Specifically, for individual symptom associations ""loss of confidence"" and ""suicide attempts"" were more strongly related in women, and ""suicidal ideation"" and ""impaired thinking"" in men. For symptom centrality, ""anxiety"" played a central role in men's symptomatology, whereas ""hopelessness"", ""loss of confidence"", ""distress"" and ""slowness of movement"" were the most central symptoms in the women's group. LIMITATIONS: Reliance on cross-sectional data precludes us from determining the direction and temporality of the association between different symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that specific symptoms should be prioritised in the prevention, diagnosis assessment and treatment of depressed patients based on sex. Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

The purpose of this study is to explore the relationship between media use degree, big five personality and depressive symptoms with a mediation model. METHOD: This was a cross-sectional study. With 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), 10-item Big Five Inventory (BFI-10) and self-designed media usage scale, 11,031 participants aged 12 and above in 120 cities in China were collected. Pearson correlation analysis and regression analysis were performed on the data. The Process plug-in was used to construct the mediation model and explore the relationship among media use degree, big five personality and depressive symptoms. The nonparametric percentile Bootstrap method was used to test the mediating effect of personality traits. RESULTS: The degree of media use was positively correlated with depressive symptoms (r?=?0.20, P?<?0.001), and big five personality played a mediating role between the degree of media use and depressive symptoms. Among five traits, extroversion (r=-0.12, P?<?0.001), conscientiousness (r=-0.23, P?<?0.001), openness (r=-0.03, P?<?0.01) and agreeableness (r=-0.22, P?<?0.001) were negatively correlated with depressive symptoms, and neuroticism (r?=?0.25, P?<?0.001) were positively correlated with depressive symptoms. In addition, extraversion (-0.004, -0.001), conscientiousness (-0.015, -0.008), agreeableness (-0.008, -0.001) and neuroticism (-0.015, -0.007) in big five personality played a mediating role between media use and depressive symptoms. CONCLUSION: The degree of media use positively predicted depressive symptoms, and excessive media use may bring risks to mental health. People with high neuroticism, low agreeableness, low conscientiousness and low extroversion are more likely to suffer from depressive symptoms. © 2023. BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

We examined discrepancies in 81 patient-therapist dyads' alliance ratings early in treatment (3rd or 4th session) in relation to Personality Assessment Inventory clinical scales, subscales and global psychopathology. Results indicated that PAI global psychopathology (mean clinical elevation) and the scales of Aggression [AGG], Somatization [SOM], and Anxiety-Related Disorders [ARD] were significantly, negatively associated with an absolute difference of patient and therapist alliance ratings at Session 3. Higher initial scores on these clinical scales at treatment onset are associated with less difference (i.e., more convergence) in patient/ therapist ratings of alliance at Session 3. Correlations between PAI clinical subscales and absolute differences of patient and therapist alliance ratings at Session 3 also demonstrated statistically significant inverse relationships for several PAI subscales of Aggression- Attitude [AGG-A], Aggression-Physical [AGG-P], Somatic- Health Concerns [SOM-H], Anxiety-Related Disorders-Traumatic Stress [ARD-T], Anxiety-Related Disorders- Obsessive Compulsive [ARD-O], Borderline Features-Affective Instability [BOR-A], Borderline- Self-Harm [BOR-S], Anxiety-Physiological [ANX-P], Depression-Physiological [DEP-P] and Antisocial-Stimulus Seeking [ANT-S]. Again, higher scores on these subscales at treatment onset are associated with less difference (i.e., more convergence) in patient/therapist ratings. We also examined group differences between patients rating alliance higher (Group 1) and therapists rating alliance higher (Group 2) and found that Group 1 had significantly lower scores on Mania-Activity Level [MAN-A].

Purpose: Perfectionism is considered a transdiagnostic construct that characterises eating disorders (EDs) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and that could also depict orthorexia nervosa (ON). The principal aim of this study was to investigate what dimensions of perfectionism mostly represent ON. Moreover, it was evaluated if dieting impacted the presence of orthorexic features and perfectionistic behaviour. Methods: The sample consisted of two groups-the ""Diet"" (n = 93), and the ""No Diet"" (n = 94) groups-composed of people with high and low orthorexic tendencies, respectively. Participants filled out self-report questionnaires to investigate orthorexic tendencies and different facets of perfectionism. Results: Analyses highlighted that people with high orthorexic tendencies showed higher perfectionistic features and that ON had a significant relationship with different facets of perfectionism. No interactions with diet were found. Therefore, no other differences were highlighted when the group type (Diet/No Diet) was considered. Conclusions: Regardless of diet, different facets of perfectionism characterise ON: perfectionism as a personality trait and perfectionism related to EDs and to obsessive-compulsive features. Our results evidenced that perfectionism could also be considered a useful construct in the conceptualization of orthorexia nervosa.

BACKGROUND: In the recent years, several studies have shown a correlation between autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and catatonia. It is also known that both conditions are found to be associated with mood disorders. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between autistic traits and catatonic symptoms, as well as the potential mediating role of mood disorder spectrum in the relationship between them. METHODS: The total sample of 514 subjects was composed by four diagnostic groups, composed by patients affected by catatonia (CTN), borderline personality disorder (BPD), major depressive disorder (MDD) and healthy controls (HC). Subjects were assessed with the SCID-5-RV, the Adult Autism Subthreshold Spectrum (AdAS Spectrum) and the Catatonia Spectrum (CS) and the Mood Spectrum Self-Report (MOODS-SR). Statistical analyses included Pearson's coefficient calculation, multiple linear regression, and mediation analysis. RESULTS: all the correlations appear to be strongly positive and significant with the strongest coefficient emerging between AdAS Spectrum total score and CS total score (r?=?0.762, p?<?0.001). The Mediation Analysis showed that AdAS Spectrum total score showed a significant indirect effect on CS total score through MOODS-SR total score (b?=?0.168, 95% bootstrapped CI [0.127:0.207]). CONCLUSION: The present study highlights the presence of a mediating role of the mood disorder spectrum in the relationship between autistic traits and the catatonia spectrum.

Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), a prevalent sleep disorder in children, is characterized by recurring upper airway obstruction during sleep. OSAS in children can cause intermittent hypoxia and sleep fragmentation, ultimately affect brain development and further lead to cognitive impairment if lack of timely effective intervention. In recent years, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electroencephalogram (EEG) have been employed to investigate brain structure and function abnormalities in children with OSAS. Previous studies have indicated that children with OSAS showed extensive gray and white matter damage, abnormal brain function in regions such as the frontal lobe and hippocampus, as well as a significant decline in general cognitive function and executive function. However, the existing studies mainly focused on the regional activity, and the mechanism of pediatric OSAS affecting brain networks remains unknown. Moreover, it's unclear whether the alterations in brain structure and function are associated with their cognitive impairment. In this review article, we proposed two future research directions: 1) future studies should utilize the multimodal neuroimaging techniques to reveal the alterations of brain networks organization underlying pediatric OSAS; 2) further investigation is necessary to explore the relationship between brain network alteration and cognitive dysfunction in children with OSAS. With these efforts, it will be promising to identify the neuroimaging biomarkers for monitoring the brain development of children with OSAS as well as aiding its clinical diagnosis, and ultimately develop more effective strategies for intervention, diagnosis, and treatment.

Contrary to the law of less work, individuals with high levels of need for cognition and self-control tend to choose harder tasks more often. While both traits can be integrated into a core construct of dispositional cognitive effort investment, its relation to actual cognitive effort investment remains unclear. As individuals with high levels of cognitive effort investment are characterized by a high intrinsic motivation towards effortful cognition, they would be less likely to increase their effort based on expected payoff, but rather based on increasing demand. In the present study, we measured actual effort investment on multiple dimensions, i.e., subjective load, reaction time, accuracy, early and late frontal midline theta power, N2 and P3 amplitude, and pupil dilation. In a sample of N = 148 participants, we examined the relationship of dispositional cognitive effort investment and effort indices during a flanker and an n-back task with varying demand and payoff. Exploratorily, we examined this relationship for the two subdimensions cognitive motivation and effortful-self-control as well. In both tasks, effort indices were sensitive to demand and partly to payoff. The analyses revealed a main effect of cognitive effort investment for accuracy (n-back task), interaction effects with payoff for reaction time (n-back and flanker task) and P3 amplitude (n-back task) and demand for early frontal midline theta power (flanker task). Taken together, our results partly support the notion that individuals with high levels of cognitive effort investment exert effort more efficiently. Moreover, the notion that these individuals exert effort regardless of payoff is partly supported, too. This may further our understanding of the conditions under which person-situation interactions occur, i.e. the conditions under which situations determine effort investment in goal-directed behavior more than personality, and vice versa.

This preliminary study aims at extending existing empirical evidence on subtypes of borderline personality disorders (BPDs) by identifying subtypes among patients with BPD, comparing their characteristics to the trait domains of the dimensional model of the International Classification of Diseases, 11th Revision (ICD-11; World Health Organization [WHO], 2022), and examining differences in sociodemographic, clinical, and therapeutic outcome variables. Data of N = 109 patients were subjected to cluster analysis based on the International Personality Disorder Examination variables for BPD and analyzed regarding differences in clinical and therapeutic variables. Clustering suggested a three-cluster solution, namely, internalizing (n = 35), externalizing (n = 28), and mixed subtype (n = 46). Subtypes showed differences in clinical variables and therapeutic outcomes with the internalizing showing more affective disorders and the mixed subtype showing the lowest therapeutic change in borderline-specific symptoms. Together, the present results correspond to the model of the ICD-11 (WHO, 2022). Clinical and treatment implications are being discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved).

Personality disorders (PDs) are associated with high levels of societal costs, regardless of whether a single PD or a broad range of PDs have been studied. However, research on the relative contribution of specific PD-types on societal costs is limited. The aim of this study was to explore the possible contributions of the individual DSM-5 categories of PDs on the level of societal costs and its components (health service costs and productivity loss), while controlling for the impact of comorbid mental health and substance use disorders on these outcomes. Participants (n?=?798) were retrieved from the quality register of the Norwegian Network for Personality Disorders-a collaboration of PD-treatment units within specialist mental health services. The patients were referred to treatment in the time-period 2017-2020. Costs were assessed using a structured interview covering the 6-month period prior to assessment. Diagnoses were determined by semi-structured diagnostic interviews (SCID-5-PD and M.I.N.I.). Statistics included multiple regression analyses. The main result was that no specific PD had a unique contribution to the high level of societal costs generally found among treatment-seeking patients with PDs. Borderline PD (BPD) was the only PD with significantly higher health service costs than the other PDs, while BPD, avoidant PD, and unspecified PD were independently associated with enhanced productivity loss. The differential cost-effects of specific PDs on the cost components were small. Several comorbid mental health and substance use disorders were significant contributors to costs, irrespective of PD status. The results underscore the importance of developing and implementing effective treatments for a broader range of PDs, to reduce the high levels of societal costs associated with all PDs. © 2023.

BACKGROUND: A negative response towards a current pregnancy consists of two elements: unwantedness of and unhappiness about the current pregnancy. Little is clear about whether pregnant women can be categorized in terms of unwantedness and unhappiness as well as what the correlates are of these categories. METHODS: An internet survey of 696 women in their first trimester of pregnancy examined the participants' intention of and emotional reaction towards pregnancy, borderline personality traits, adult attachment style, depression, fear of childbirth, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, fetal bonding disorder, avoidance of taking part in child care, and consideration about termination of pregnancy (TOP). About one third of the participants were followed up with in their second trimester. RESULTS: Two-step cluster analysis using the participants' intention of and emotional reaction towards pregnancy revealed three groups of pregnant women: those who wanted and were happy about the pregnancy (Cluster 1), those who were unhappy about the pregnancy (Cluster 2), and those who did not intend to be pregnant but were happy about pregnancy (Cluster 3). Cluster 2 women, but not Cluster 3 women, were likely to be single, with borderline personality traits as well as unstable adult attachment styles, accompanied by depression, fear of childbirth, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and fetal bonding disorder. They were more likely to avoid caring for the baby after childbirth and consider TOP. CONCLUSION: Expectant women who were unhappy about their pregnancy were at risk of psychological adjustment and need specific perinatal mental health assessment and care.

There are no previous studies of the psychopathology associated with different aetiologies of chronic pruritus. A systematic review was performed of cohort and case-control studies comparing healthy controls with patients with chronic pruritus related to primary dermatoses, systemic diseases, psychogenic pruritus, idiopathic pruritus, prurigo nodularis and/or lichen simplex chronicus. The review was registered in PROSPERO and performed according to the PRISMA statement, which allowed the inclusion of 26 studies. The quality of eligible studies was assessed using the modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Most of the studies concern primary dermatoses and systemic diseases. Sleep disorders are a common comorbidity interrelated with pruritus, anxiety and depressive symptoms, in primary dermatoses. Sleep disorders are linked with pruritus and depressive symptoms in end-stage renal disease and hepatobiliary disease. Depressive and anxiety symptoms are associated with psychogenic pruritus. Psychogenic pruritus, lichen simplex chronicus and some primary dermatoses are linked with personality characteristics. Further studies are required to explore in depth the psychopathology linked with psychogenic pruritus and prurigo nodularis, as well as psychopathology linked with other primary dermatoses and systemic disorders associated with chronic pruritus, and to better differentiate psychogenic pruritus from psychopathological characteristics linked with other aetiologies of chronic pruritus, in order to improve the management of patients with chronic pruritus.

INTRODUCTION: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a complex mental disorder with core symptoms like interpersonal instability, emotion dysregulation, self-harm, and impulsive decision-making. Previous neuropsychological studies have found impairment in the decision-making of patients with BPD related to impulsivity. In our study, we focus on a better, more nuanced understanding of impulsive decision-making in BPD with the help of Rogers' decision-making test that simulates a gambling situation. METHODS: A novelty of our study is that we excluded from further analysis non-compliant participants based on their performance. Outlier participants on the measures proportion of good choices and average of wager choice number were filtered out to represent the population that understood the basic premise of the task and showed minimal motivation to gain rewards. Thus participants often choosing the less likely color or frequently choosing the first bet amount available (to probably speed up the test) were omitted from further analysis. Another novelty is that we assessed and reported six variables that examine Deliberation Time, Quality of Decision, Risk-taking, Overall proportion bet, Delay aversion, and Risk adjustment. Forty-three women with BPD participated in the study, and 16 non-compliant were excluded. As for the healthy control group, 42 women participated in the study, and four non-compliant were excluded. Thus, we compared the data of 27 patients with BPD with 38 healthy controls. RESULTS: Our results show that there are significant differences amongst the groups regarding the Quality of Decision Making (F (1,63)?=?5.801, p?=?0.019) and Risk Adjustment (F (1,63)?=?6.522, p?=?0.013). We also found significant interactions between group and winning probability regarding Risk Taking (F (4,252)?=?4.765 p?=?0.001) and Overall proportion of bets, i.e., the average proportion of bets relative to the total score of the subject (F (4,252)?=?4.505, p?=?0.002). DISCUSSION: Our results show that the two groups use different decision-making strategies that can have various associations with everyday life situations.

BACKGROUND: There is preliminary evidence that childhood emotional abuse (CEA) is a risk factor for adolescent mentalizing difficulties (Uncertainty/Confusion about mental states) and borderline personality features and that Uncertainty/Confusion about mental states mediate the relationship between CEA and adolescent borderline personality features, but these findings need replication. Furthermore, no previous studies have examined the relationship between adolescent mentalizing deficits, anxiety, and depression in the context of CEA. OBJECTIVES: This study examined the associations between CEA, adolescent borderline personality features, depression and anxiety symptoms and tested a pathway model where Uncertainty/Confusion about mental states mediates the relationships between CEA and adolescent borderline personality features, depression and anxiety symptoms. METHOD: A clinical sample of 94 adolescents completed the Reflective Function Questionnaire for Youth (RFQY) to assess mentalizing, the Childhood Experiences of Care and Abuse Questionnaire (CECA-Q), the Borderline Personality Disorders Features Scale (BPFS-C), and the Beck Youth Inventories for Depression (BDI-Y) and Anxiety (BAI-Y). RESULTS: Uncertainty/Confusion about mental states partially mediated the relationship between CEA and borderline traits as well as anxiety. In addition, there was an indirect effect where CEA predicted Uncertainty/Confusion about mental states, which then predicted depression. DISCUSSION: The findings are consistent with the mentalizing model of psychopathology and provide new evidence that Uncertainty/Confusion about mental states might be a critical mentalizing deficit that characterizes the associations between CEA and adolescent BPD features and depression and anxiety symptoms. Uncertainty/Confusion may be a transdiagnostic risk factor for adolescent psychological distress and dysfunction. We discuss the clinical implications.

OBJECTIVE: While targeted rehabilitation can enhance hearing aid self-efficacy (HASE), little research has been done to determine the factors contributing to its predictive value. By investigating the experiences of individuals who successfully use HAs and have high levels of HASE, we hoped to illuminate specific strategies and/or sources of support these individuals share that might explain why high HASE is often linked to successful outcomes. DESIGN AND STUDY SAMPLE: This qualitative study explored the experiences of five older adults who were successful HA users and reported having high HASE. Semi-structured interview guides were developed using the transtheoretical model of behavioral change as a framework. Interviews were analyzed thematically and holistically. RESULTS: Participants attributed their HA success to: intrinsic motivation to improve their hearing, confident self-reliance when making health decisions, willingness to act on advice from trusted others, pro-social personal attributes, positive expectations about HA outcomes, and actively pursuing an optimal HA outcome. CONCLUSIONS: For these participants, internal factors related to emotional state and source of motivation, and, to a lesser extent, verbal persuasion played a crucial role in their long-term success. This suggests that external influencers might be less impactful in facilitating success for those with high HASE. DOI: 10.1080/14992027.2023.2243541 PMID: 37607212  7.

People often form polarized beliefs, imbuing objects (e.g., themselves or others) with unambiguously positive or negative qualities. In clinical settings, this is referred to as dichotomous thinking or ""splitting"" and is a feature of several psychiatric disorders. Here, we introduce a Bayesian model of splitting that parameterizes a tendency to rigidly categorize objects as either entirely ""Bad"" or ""Good,"" rather than to flexibly learn dispositions along a continuous scale. Distinct from the previous descriptive theories, the model makes quantitative predictions about how dichotomous beliefs emerge and are updated in light of new information. Specifically, the model addresses how splitting is context-dependent, yet exhibits stability across time. A key model feature is that phases of devaluation and/or idealization are consolidated by rationally attributing counter-evidence to external factors. For example, when another person is idealized, their less-than-perfect behavior is attributed to unfavorable external circumstances. However, sufficient counter-evidence can trigger switches of polarity, producing bistable dynamics. We show that the model can be fitted to empirical data, to measure individual susceptibility to relational instability. For example, we find that a latent categorical belief that others are ""Good"" accounts for less changeable, and more certain, character impressions of benevolent as opposed to malevolent others among healthy participants. By comparison, character impressions made by participants with borderline personality disorder reveal significantly higher and more symmetric splitting. The generative framework proposed invites applications for modeling oscillatory relational and affective dynamics in psychotherapeutic contexts.

RATIONALE: Clozapine is a unique medication with a potential role in the treatment of severe borderline personality disorder (BPD). OBJECTIVES: The review examines the effectiveness of clozapine as a medication for management for severe BPD with high risk of suicide, violence or imprisonment, and aims to help guide clinical practice in managing severe BPD. METHODS: A database search of the terms ""Clozapine"" AND ""BPD""; ""Antipsychotics"" AND ""BPD""; ""Clozapine"" AND ""Borderline Personality Disorder""; and ""Antipsychotics"" AND ""Borderline Personality Disorder"" were performed in CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Embase, Medline, PsychINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science. Full-text articles of clinical clozapine use for BPD were included for review. RESULTS: A total of 24 articles consisting of 1 randomised control trial, 10 non-controlled trials, and 13 case reports were identified. Most of the studies reported benefits from clozapine when used for severe BPD. Many of the studies focused on clozapine use in BPD patients at high risk of suicide. Results from these non-controlled and case reports support the use of clozapine in patients with severe BPD at high risk of suicide. CONCLUSION: There may be a role for clozapine in treating severe treatment refractory BPD, especially for those patients at high risk of suicide and frequent hospitalisations. © 2023. Crown.

However, the underlying neurobiological mechanism linking passive CS and perceived stress to anxiety susceptibility remains elusive. Thus, we aimed to investigate the relationships among passive CS, brain functional connectivity, perceived stress, and anxiety in young adults. METHODS: Data from the longitudinal Gene-Brain-Behavior Project(GBB) and Southwest University Longitudinal Imaging Multimodal Project(SLIM) were used. We confirmed the relationship among anxiety, passive CS and perceived stress. Then, we investigated the mediated functional connectivity between passive CS and perceived stress, and used these functional connections to predict present anxiety and follow-up anxiety one year later. RESULTS: Anxiety scores were significantly positively correlated with passive CS and perceived stress. At the brain network level, connections within the default mode network (DMN) and between the somatomotor network (SMN) and subcortical network (SUN) mediated the relationship between passive CS and perceived stress. Furthermore, present anxiety and follow-up anxiety one year later could be predicted by these mediated functional connections. Nodes with greater predictive contribution were mainly located in the left anterior cingulate gyrus (ACC), left inferior parietal gyrus (IPG), right superior frontal gyrus (SFG), and left middle frontal gyrus (MFG), mainly distributed on the DMN. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrated that the mediated neurobiological mechanisms between passive CS and perceived stress could be used to predict present and future anxiety, which enhance understanding of the neurobiological basis of anxiety susceptibility in this passive CS and perceived stress and may have implications for early preventing and intervening mental disorders.

Previous research demonstrates that parents' communication skills may contribute to the development and maintenance of their young person's borderline personality disorder (BPD). Carers of people with BPD also experience their own psychosocial stressors and feel unsupported. Consequently, Dialectical Behavior Therapy for adolescents (DBT-A) invites parents to partake in group therapy alongside their young person. Despite this involvement, little research exists examining parents' perspective of engaging in a DBT-A program, and specifically whether they experience their own benefits and changes from being part of the program. To examine this, the current study interviews 34 parents who engaged in an early intervention DBT-A program. Thematic analysis resulted in seven key themes and 16 subthemes beginning with parents' expectations of the program, followed by the key elements of the program that facilitated change, and the actual changes and benefits attributed to these elements. Overall, parents were surprised by their own gains from the program, and how the skills they learned facilitated personal development that improved family communication and functioning with their young person and more broadly. This study addresses the gap in understanding the parent perspective with clinical implications for the benefits of involving parents in therapy more generally. © 2023 The Authors.

This study explores the relationship between bright- and dark-side personality traits and four major styles of defense mechanisms (DMs) as this relationship remains unexplored and important in understanding the DMs. In all, 435 adult working participants (241 men; 194 women; Mean age 46.06 yrs) mainly in middle management jobs, completed a 78-item, six-trait measure of bright-side personality (HPTI: High Potential Type Indicator), a 25-item five-trait measure of the dark-side personality (PID-5;BF: DSM-5-Brief Form) and 88-item, four-styles measure of defense mechanisms (Defense Style Questionnaire). The aim was to examine demographic (sex, age, education), ideological and personality trait correlates of the DMs. It was hypothesized that the dark-side traits, particularly Detachment would be most strongly related to the DMs. Thereafter, a hierarchical linear regression was performed with each DM factor as criterion and predictors being demography, ideology, self-esteem as well as bright- and dark-side personality traits. Detachment was associated with all DMs, particularly Maladaptive (r = 0.68) and Image Distorting Style (r = 0.38) while Conscientiousness was associated with none. One implication concerns the assessment of DMs by standard tests. Limitations are acknowledged and include method invariance and sample homogeneity. Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

PURPOSE: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) and eating disorders are highly comorbid, but the shared course of symptoms and associated risks remain poorly understood. The aim of this study was to examine joint symptom trajectories, temporal precedence, risk factors, and population attributable fractions (PAFs) in a community sample of adolescents, using a developmental psychopathology and psychosocial framework. METHODS: Across five years (age 14-18 years), adolescents (n = 544, 56% girls) reported on BPD features and disordered eating behavior. Sociodemographic, interpersonal, and clinical risks were assessed in childhood (age 10-13 years). We used a person-centered approach to examine latent class growth analyses, joint trajectory models, and calculated PAFs. RESULTS: Three-class solutions were found for both disordered eating and BPD features (low, moderate, high), creating nine joint trajectories. High levels of disordered eating were a stronger indicator of high levels of BPD features than was the reverse. Girls and LGBTQ+ youth were most likely to be in a high symptom trajectory. Bullying perpetration and clinical hyperactivity were unique risks for BPD features. Bullying victimization contributed the largest PAF to disordered eating and BPD features. CONCLUSION: We identified several novel and clinically relevant findings related to temporality, risks, screening, and the treatment of adolescent eating problems and BPD.

The purpose of this study is to explore the relationship between media use degree, big five personality and depressive symptoms with a mediation model. METHOD: This was a cross-sectional study. With 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), 10-item Big Five Inventory (BFI-10) and self-designed media usage scale, 11,031 participants aged 12 and above in 120 cities in China were collected. Pearson correlation analysis and regression analysis were performed on the data. The Process plug-in was used to construct the mediation model and explore the relationship among media use degree, big five personality and depressive symptoms. The nonparametric percentile Bootstrap method was used to test the mediating effect of personality traits. RESULTS: The degree of media use was positively correlated with depressive symptoms (r?=?0.20, P?<?0.001), and big five personality played a mediating role between the degree of media use and depressive symptoms. Among five traits, extroversion (r=-0.12, P?<?0.001), conscientiousness (r=-0.23, P?<?0.001), openness (r=-0.03, P?<?0.01) and agreeableness (r=-0.22, P?<?0.001) were negatively correlated with depressive symptoms, and neuroticism (r?=?0.25, P?<?0.001) were positively correlated with depressive symptoms. In addition, extraversion (-0.004, -0.001), conscientiousness (-0.015, -0.008), agreeableness (-0.008, -0.001) and neuroticism (-0.015, -0.007) in big five personality played a mediating role between media use and depressive symptoms. CONCLUSION: The degree of media use positively predicted depressive symptoms, and excessive media use may bring risks to mental health. People with high neuroticism, low agreeableness, low conscientiousness and low extroversion are more likely to suffer from depressive symptoms. © 2023. BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

BACKGROUND: Morningness (morning-eveningness preference or chronotypes) and personality can be both associated with well-being, but few studies have directly compared these two constructs as correlates of well-being. Thus, the first purpose of this study was to test the effects of interactions between stable personality traits (temperaments) and morningness on well-being. Furthermore, personality factors are often composed of both stable biological factors (temperament) and socio-cultural factors (character), and little is known about personality interplay of temperament and character factors with respect to morningness and well-being. The second purpose of this study was therefore to examine the sequential mediating effects of temperament and character factors on the relationship between morningness and well-being. METHODS: The Composite Scale of Morningness, the Korean version of the Temperament and Character Inventory-Revised Short Version (TCI-RS), and the Satisfaction with Life Scale were used to measure morningness, personality dimensions, and well-being, respectively, in 287 Korean university students. Moderating and sequentially mediating effects of temperament and character traits were determined using Hayes' PROCESS macro in SPSS after controlling for sex and age. RESULTS: First, novelty-seeking (NS) and persistence (PS) temperaments have demonstrated the moderating effect in the association between morningness and well-being. The positive effects of morningness on life satisfaction increased with lower NS and PS, respectively. However, other temperaments such as harm avoidance (HA) and reward dependence (RD) have not shown the moderation in the relationship between morningness on well-being. Second, HA temperament and self-directedness (SD) character sequentially mediated the relationship between morningness and well-being. The combination of low scores of HA and high scores of SD have shown the positive effect on the relationship between morningness and well-being. DISCUSSION: This study demonstrated that both the interactions between temperaments and morningness, and combination of specific TCI-RS temperament and character traits play important roles in influencing the association between morningness and well-being. The significance of the mature SD character and its implications for well-being are discussed with limitation of the present study. © 2023 Lee et al.

Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is characterized by emotional instability, impulsivity and unstable interpersonal relationships. Patients experience discomforting levels of distress, inducing symptoms like dissociation, aggression or withdrawal. Social situations are particularly challenging, and acute social stress can reduce patients' cognitive and social functioning. In patients with Major Depressive Disorder or Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, which show high comorbidity with BPD, theendocrine stress response is characterized by Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction, which affects cognitive functioning. Compared to these clinical groups, research on HPA-axis function in BPD is relatively scarce, but evidence points towards a blunted cortisol reactivity to acute stress. Since BPD patients are particularly prone to social stress and experience high subjective difficulties in these situations, it seems plausible that HPA-axis dysregulation might contribute to de-creased social cognition in BPD. The present review summarizes findings on the HPA-axis function in BPD and its association with social cognition following acute social stress. For this purpose, we re- view literature that employed a widely used social stressor (Trier Social Stress Test, TSST) to study the effects of acute social stress on social cognition and the HPA-axis response. We contrast these findings with studies on social cognition that employed Cyberball, another widely used social stressor that lacks HPA-axis involvement. We conclude that research on social cognition in BPD reveals heter- ogeneous results with no clear relationship between social functioning and HPA-axis response. More research is needed to better understand the psychophysiological underpinnings of impaired social cog- nition in BPD.

Using the rationale of upper echelons theory, the present study introduces CEO narcissism, an important but underexplored psychological trait, and dynamic capability to probe the mechanisms driving green innovation. The regression findings show that enterprises with narcissistic CEOs do better in terms of green innovation. According to the mediation study findings, dynamic capability mediates between the CEO narcissism and corporate green innovation. In addition, the examination of mediated moderation reveals that top management risk aversion could negatively moderate this mediation effect. Such observations not only show that the CEO's personality has the potential to enhance corporate green achievements, but also discover the underlying mechanism which would provide guidance to help firms to be green. © 2023 The Authors.

Research has shown links between homelessness and criminal legal involvement in military veterans. The present study aimed to determine the magnitude and directionality of this association by investigating the incidence of, and factors associated with, homelessness preceding criminal arrest among veterans. Data on incarcerated veterans (N = 1,602) were analyzed from the 2016 Survey of Prison Inmates conducted by the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics. In this survey, 27% of incarcerated veterans reported homelessness 12 months before criminal arrest. In multivariable logistic regression analyses, higher odds of experiencing homelessness preceding criminal arrest were associated with younger age, non-White race, substance use disorder (with or without serious mental illness [SMI]), history of previous arrests, parental history of incarceration, and history of homelessness before age 18. These factors were found to be the same for nonveterans, as were rates of homelessness before arrest. However, incarcerated veterans were more likely to have mental disorders, including SMI, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and personality disorders. In contrast, incarcerated nonveterans were more likely to have a criminal history, including past arrests, parental incarceration, and juvenile detention. Although policymakers may be aware that some veterans they serve are at risk of criminal legal involvement, these national data reveal the magnitude and directionality of this problem: more than one in four incarcerated veterans experienced homelessness before criminal arrest. Identifying characteristics of veterans who experienced homelessness before criminal arrest directly informs service providers of demographic, historical, and clinical factors to evaluate and address to prevent criminal legal involvement.

BACKGROUND: This study focused on the impact of therapeutic alliance on therapy dropout in a naturalistic sample of patients with borderline pathology receiving dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) in a residential setting. We assumed that low therapeutic alliance shortly after admission would be associated with elevated dropout. METHODS: 44 participants with borderline pathology (??3 DSM-5 borderline personality disorder criteria) in a residential DBT program completed a quality assurance questionnaire set assessing demographic information, pretreatment psychopathology and therapeutic alliance during the first seven days of their residential stay. Predictors of dropout were investigated using binary logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: The dropout rate was 34.1% (n?=?15). In binary logistic regression analyses with variables covering demographic and clinical characteristics, comorbidities and childhood trauma history, only the therapeutic alliance significantly predicted dropout (z = -2.371, p?=?.018). CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the importance of therapy process variables, here the therapeutic alliance at the beginning of treatment, as predictors of therapy dropout in borderline pathology. If this finding is replicated, it shows the potential importance of monitoring the therapeutic relationship throughout the therapeutic process.

(#)Contributed equally BACKGROUND: Reliable outcome data of psychosomatic inpatient and day hospital treatment with a focus on psychotherapy are important to strengthen ecological validity by assessing the reality of mental health care in the field. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of inpatient and day hospital treatment in German university departments of Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy in a prospective, naturalistic, multicenter design including structured assessments. METHODS: Structured interviews were used to diagnose mental disorders according to ICD-10 and DSM-IV at baseline. Depression, anxiety, somatization, eating disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, as well as personality functioning were assessed by means of questionnaires on admission and at discharge. RESULTS: 2,094 patients recruited by 19 participating university hospitals consented to participation in the study. Effect sizes for each of the outcome criteria were calculated for 4-5 sub-groups per outcome domain with differing severity at baseline. Pre-post effect sizes for patients with moderate and high symptom severity at baseline ranged from d = 0.78 to d = 3.61 with symptoms of PTSD, depression, and anxiety showing the largest and somatization as well as personality functioning showing somewhat smaller effects. CONCLUSIONS: Inpatient and day hospital treatment in German university departments of Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy is effective under field conditions.

Borderline personality disorders account for 50% of adolescent hospitalization cases in psychiatry. The severity and psychopathological complexity of these symptoms indicate the need for inclusive models of understanding. Adopting a holistic approach allows for the consideration of not only the patient's environment, but also their position within that environment and their life history. In this article, a model based on the concept of therapeutic containment at three levels is presented. Global containment refers to the mindset and organization of the institution that provides care, which is itself a part of society at a specific time. Local containment focuses on understanding and therapeutic interventions within the immediate social environment of the individual. Lastly, individual containment encompasses the development of independent processes during the course of care. These three levels are integrated in the hospital treatment of borderline personality disorders, forming a trans-theoretical approach.

PURPOSE: Phyllodes tumors are rare breast neoplasms with limited prospective data to guide treatment, leading to heterogeneous management of this disease. We developed National consensus statements using modified Delphi methodology including patients and practitioners across Canada. METHODS: Statements were developed based on a literature review. Two iterations of surveys were distributed with a planned virtual consensus meeting. Panelists were invited from surgery, radiation oncology, medical oncology, pathology, radiology, and plastic surgery. RESULTS: Twenty-three participants attended the virtual conference. One hundred statements regarding diagnostics, pathology, surgical planning, adjuvant therapies, recurrence, surveillance, and patient support were approved with an a priori defined consensus of ? 80%. Two tables on locoregional management were developed and approved. The management of borderline phyllodes tumors was a source of uncertainty, and recommendations reflect the lack of evidence in this rare presentation. CONCLUSION: A consensus document containing all approved statements for the care and management of phyllodes tumors was developed to help guide practice and future research. © 2023.

(2)Department of Psychiatry, University of Social Welfare and Rehabilitation Sciences, Tehran, Iran. Objective: The Personality Inventory for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (PID-5), is a trait-based measure of pathological personality designed to assess Criterion B of an alternative diagnostic system for personality disorders (PDs). In this study, we aimed to evaluate the relations among the PID-5 and the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2-Restructured Form (MMPI-2-RF); a commonly used self-report instrument with a hierarchical structure. Method : We examined the joint structure of the PID-5 scales along with levels of the MMPI-2-RF hierarchy to understand whether conceptually expected structures tend to be loaded with each other. Data were collected from 536 participants from the general population of Iran. Results: Findings of Pearson's correlation analyses exhibited the generally expected patterns between the two mentioned measures on most scales, with some divergences. Similarly, although applying a set of joint exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM) exhibited some factor loadings for PID-5 facets within the hierarchical framework of MMPI-2-RF scales that were different to what was theoretically expected, both measures were generally loaded in a conceptually expected way, indicating that they have a similar dimensional structure. Conclusion: Our findings provide support for adequate convergence of maladaptive personality traits and psychopathology structures, as well as for utilizing MMPI-2-RF to measure personality psychopathology from a dimensional perspective. The implications of these results are discussed by the authors. Copyright © 2023 Tehran University of Medical Sciences. Published by Tehran University of Medical Sciences.

AIMS: To investigate personality functioning and sense of self in individuals at ultra-high risk (UHR) for psychosis and with first-episode psychosis (FEP) in comparison with a clinical control group of individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD) and healthy controls. METHOD: In a cross-sectional design, we investigated personality functioning (Structured Interview of Personality Organization, STIPO; Level of Personality Functioning Scale, LPFS) and disturbances of the basic self (Examination of Anomalous Self-Experience, EASE) in 107 participants, comprising 24 individuals at UHR, 29 individuals with FEP, 27 individuals with BPD and 27 healthy controls. RESULTS: The UHR, FEP and BPD groups had moderate to severe deficits in personality organisation (STIPO) compared with the healthy control group. Self-functioning with its subdomain (facet) 'self-direction' (LPFS) was significantly worse in participants with manifest psychosis (FEP) compared with those at-risk for psychosis (UHR). The FEP group showed significantly worse overall personality functioning than the UHR group and significantly higher levels of self-disturbance (EASE) than the BPD group, with the UHR group lying between these diagnostic groups. Hierarchical cluster analysis based on the seven STIPO domains yielded three clusters differing in level of personality functioning and self-disturbances. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that psychotic disorders are associated with impaired personality functioning and self-disturbances. Assessment of personality functioning can inform treatment planning for patients at different stages of psychotic disorder. DOI: 10.1192/bjo.2023.530 PMID: 37563768  47.

OBJECTIVE: Negative urgency (NU) and distress tolerance (DT) are two similar yet distinct constructs with putative transdiagnostic relevance, particularly across psychopathology characterized by impulsivity (e.g., substance use disorders [SUD], eating disorders featuring binging and/or purging ED-B/P, and borderline personality disorder [BPD]). Yet, there remains a lack of research into NU and DT across SUD, ED-B/P, and BPD symptomatology in clinical populations. The present study sought to elucidate the transdiagnostic utility of NU and DT across impulsive-type psychology by examining the unique and interactive roles of NU and DT across SUD, ED-B/P, and BPD symptomatology within a treatment-seeking sample of young people. METHOD: Participants (N?=?385; 62.3% female; aged 16-25 years) were recruited from youth health services across Melbourne, Australia. Participants completed an online survey including self-report measures of NU and DT as well as SUD, ED-B/P, and BPD symptoms. Mixed effects logistic regression was used to explore unique and interactive associations of NU and DT with symptoms. RESULTS: Both NU (adjusted odds ratio [ORadj ]?=?1.22; 95% confidence interval [CI]?=?[1.16, 1.28]) and global DT (ORadj ?=?0.59; 95% CI?=?[0.47, 0.74]) uniquely predicted symptoms. However, associations with global DT and most of its components differed across psychopathology types. No significant interactions between NU and DT in predicting symptoms were found. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the transdiagnostic utility of NU across SUD, ED-B/P, and BPD, while suggesting the role of DT across these disorders is more nuanced. These findings have important implications for NU and DT as potential intervention targets. © 2023 The Authors. Journal of Clinical Psychology published by Wiley Periodicals LLC.

OBJECTIVE: This study examined whether phenotypic correlations between psychopathological dimensions and personality traits of different hierarchical levels originate from common genetic and environmental sources of variance. METHOD: Participants were 386 monozygotic and 204 dizygotic twins. The Psychiatric Diagnostic Screening Questionnaire (PDSQ) was applied along with the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R). The results of the CFA confirmed the hypothesis of the internalizing and externalizing dimensions underlying PDSQ scales. RESULTS: The results indicated a significantly greater role of genetic compared to environmental factors in the relationship between internalizing psychopathology and personality traits. Facets of neuroticism showed positive genetic links with internalizing disorders, while negative genetic links were shown for all facets of extraversion except excitement-seeking, competence, self-discipline, achievement striving, actions, and trust. Lower-order personality traits were shown to be associated with internalizing disorders more intensively than the broader domains to which they belong, both at the phenotypic and genetic levels. CONCLUSIONS: High neuroticism, together with several facets from the domain of extraversion and conscientiousness seems to represent an increased genetic susceptibility to the disorders from the internalizing spectrum. Results also suggest that specific environmental factors which are not shared with personality traits contribute to the internalizing symptoms. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

BACKGROUND: Surgery is the primary treatment for locally advanced differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). However, some locally advanced patients are not candidates for R0/1 resection. There is limited evidence of neoadjuvant treatment in locally advanced DTC. Surufatinib targets multiple kinases, which is efficient, tolerable, and safe in patients with radioiodine-refractory DTC. In addition, surufatinib plus toripalimab (an anti-PD-1 antibody) showed encouraging antitumor activity in advanced solid tumors. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of surufatinib plus toripalimab in locally advanced DTC in the neoadjuvant setting. METHODS: In this single-arm, phase II study, patients with pathologically confirmed unresectable or borderline resectable DTC were eligible and received a combination of 250 mg of surufatinib (orally daily) with 240 mg of toripalimab (intravenous, every 3 weeks). Treatment continued until satisfied for curative surgery, disease progression, withdrawal of consent, unacceptable toxicity, or investigator decision. Primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). Secondary endpoints included R0/1 resection rate, adverse events (AEs), etc. RESULTS: Ten patients were enrolled and received at least 4 cycles of treatment. The ORR was 60%. Nine patients received R0/1 resections after neoadjuvant treatment. The median best percentage change in the sum of the target lesion diameter was 32%. Most adverse events (AEs) were grade 1 or 2. CONCLUSIONS: Surufatinib in combination with toripalimab as neoadjuvant therapy for locally advanced DTC was feasible, and the majority of patients achieved R0/1 resection. It represents a new option for locally advanced DTC and needs further investigation. © 2023. Society of Surgical Oncology. DOI: 10.1245/s10434-023-14031-z PMID: 37543550  47.

BACKGROUND: Regardless of its rare occurrence, Thymoma remains the most frequently encountered primary tumor of the anterior mediastinum comprising about 50% of all masses in the region. Surgical resection, via thymectomy, remains the mainstay treatment modality. In locally advanced and borderline resectable tumors, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) may be utilized to increase the chance of R0 resection, raising the question of its efficacy and safety. METHODS: Demographic and clinical data from patients who presented to a tertiary cancer center between January 2015-October 2021 with a diagnosis of thymoma and underwent curative surgical resection was collected. Computed tomography scan was used to delineate clinical staging, tumor size and to detect post-therapeutic variations in tumor burden. The response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) was used to classify the effect of NACT on tumor burden. The pathological response was determined by measuring the percentage of necrotic tissue. RESULTS: A total of 23 patients were diagnosed with thymoma. Most patients were male with a mean age 46 (±?15) years at diagnosis. The most common clinical stage was stage II with 5 patients (22%). A total of 12 patients had NACT as compared to 11 patients who had upfront surgery. The mean change in tumor volume was 165 cm3 (p?=?0.079) and the change in and maximum diameter was 1.53?±?1.49 cm (p?<?0.01). The effect of NACT on tumor burden based on RECIST criteria was minimal as 8 patients had stable disease. Based on pathological findings, the average necrotic portion of the tumor was 39.5% (p?=?0.152). The overall survival rate is 95.65%, mean survival was 115 months (4-125). Recurrence occurred in 5 patients. The NACT group had a higher risk for recurrence (4; 33.3%) with a mean survival of 43.8 months compared to 59.6 months in those who did not receive induction therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The exact role of induction chemotherapy in locally advanced thymoma patients remains controversial. NACT effect after utilizing radiological and pathological assessment tools was not found to significantly improve oncological outcomes compared to upfront surgery in locally advanced disease, with minimal radiologic and pathologic effect. To further demonstrate the impact of induction chemotherapy, we recommend multicentric collaborative studies. © 2023. BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

BACKGROUND: Anxiety and depression are among the greatest contributors to the global burden of diseases. The close associations of personality traits with anxiety and depression have been widely described. However, the common practice of sum scores in previous studies limits the understanding of the fine-grained connections between different personality traits and anxiety and depression symptoms and cannot explore and compare the risk or protective effects of personality traits on anxiety and depression symptoms. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the fine-grained connections between different personality traits and anxiety and depression symptoms and identify the detrimental or protective effects of different personality traits on anxiety and depression symptoms. METHODS: A total of 536 college students from China were recruited online, and the average age was 19.98?±?1.11. The Chinese version of the Ten-Item Personality Inventory, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 was used to investigate the personality traits and symptoms of anxiety and depression of participants after they understood the purpose and filling method of the survey and signed the informed consent. The demographic characteristics were summarized, and the scale scores were calculated. The network model of personality traits and symptoms of anxiety and depression was constructed, and bridge expected influence (BEI) was measured to evaluate the effect of personality traits on anxiety and depression. The edge accuracy and BEI stability were estimated, and the BEI difference and the edge weight difference were tested. RESULTS: In the network, 29 edges (indicating partial correlations between variables) bridged the personality community and the anxiety and depression community, among which the strongest correlations were extraversion-fatigue, agreeableness-suicidal ideation, conscientiousness-uncontrollable worry, neuroticism-excessive worry, neuroticism-irritability, and openness-feelings of worthlessness. Neuroticism had the highest positive BEI value (0.32), agreeableness had the highest negative BEI value (-0.27), and the BEI values of neuroticism and agreeableness were significantly different from those of most other nodes (p?<?0.05). CONCLUSION: There are intricate correlations between personality traits and the symptoms of anxiety and depression in college students. Neuroticism was identified as the most crucial risk trait for depression and anxiety symptoms, while agreeableness was the most central protective trait. Copyright © 2023 Yang, Guo, Zhu, Liu and Guo.

OBJECTIVE: Epilepsy with eyelid myoclonia (EEM) is a rare epileptic syndrome classified within the Genetic Generalized Epilepsies of childhood. It is characterized by a high drug resistance, and little is known about prognostic factors and neurodevelopmental comorbidities. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical features, cognitive profile, and prognostic factors in a series of children with EEM. METHODS: This is a retrospective observational study of patients diagnosed with EEM from 2012 to 2022 in a tertiary pediatric hospital. RESULTS: Seventeen patients were analyzed (mean age at symptom onset 5.8?years). Neuropsychiatric comorbidities were present in 76.4% (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder 58.8%, behavioral disorder 11.8%, autism spectrum disorder 11.8%, and psychotic outbreaks 11.8%). Neurocognitive assessment was performed in 75%, revealing cognitive impairment in 66.6% (62.5% with borderline intellectual function and 37.5% with -IQ <70-), with predominant difficulties in executive functions, comprehensive language, and motor skills. Cognitive deterioration was observed in one patient in parallel onset with psychotic symptoms. High refractoriness to antiseizure medication (ASM) was observed, with only 23.5% of the patients being seizure-free after a mean follow-up of 7?years. The most effective ASM was valproic acid, and two of them received ketogenic diet with good response. Regarding prognostic factors, psychotic symptoms were associated with a greater number of antiseizure medication (p?<?.05) implying a more drug-resistant epilepsy. SIGNIFICANCE: In our study, we found a high rate of cognitive and psychiatric comorbidities and high refractoriness. These data support the concept of EEM as an intermediate entity between idiopathic generalized epilepsy and epileptic and/or neurodevelopmental encephalopathy. Making a proper diagnosis and management of these comorbidities is necessary to improve prognosis and quality of life in EEM. © 2023 International League Against Epilepsy.

INTRODUCTION: This work aims to demonstrate, through the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) responses, an altered emotional pattern in borderline personality disorder (BPD) patients and to find a specific emotional response pattern by understanding their relationship with traumatic experiences and attachment bonds towards their primary caregivers. METHOD: A total of 50 BPD patients and 39 control patients were evaluated using the IAPS, and its assessment was carried out through the Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM). Paternal and maternal attachment bonds as well as traumatic experiences in BPD patients were evaluated. Statistical associations were analysed in the different variables. RESULTS: Significant differences between BPD and control patients were found in all emotional response components for pleasant, unpleasant and neutral images (p?<?.01), with one exception, the arousal in pleasant images. Patients' experience of traumatic experiences was positively related to scores on the happiness component of pleasant imagery (p?=?.057) and on the arousal component of unpleasant imagery (p?=?.058). Poorer maternal bonding in BPD patients was significantly related to lower scores on happiness (p?<?.01) and dominance (p?<?.05) components of pleasant imagery and all emotional response components for unpleasant imagery (p?<?.01). CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study confirm an impaired emotional response pattern in patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD), showing an emotional response to pleasant images similar to that of depression, while the pattern found to unpleasant images could be related to the complex trauma observed in these patients, which includes PTSD experiences such as sexual abuse and attachment trauma experiences. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

It typically causes systolic dysfunction of the left ventricle (LV). Perhaps what is of most significance is the reversible nature of TTS, with many patients achieving recovery within a few weeks to months. TTS can be referred to by other names, attributed to its various precipitants, as well as the structural manifestations of the syndrome. Physical and emotional stressors have been identified as the most common of causes, hence the terms 'stress cardiomyopathy' and 'broken heart syndrome'. Precipitants can range from psychological, and hormonal, to molecular mechanisms. The symptoms of TTS can coalesce with other conditions and hence give rise to many differential diagnoses. Most patients present with dyspnoea and chest pain. The latter also presents in acute coronary syndrome (ACS); thus, ACS is a common differential diagnosis for TTS. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic saw a drastic increase in mental health concerns which have persisted beyond this period. Further studies into personality disorders and their potential predisposition to COVID-19 and thus TTS would advance our understanding of the neuropsychiatric triggers of TTS. There is also a need for a single sensitive and specific diagnostic test for TTS as its diagnosis relies on the culmination of clinical presentation, echocardiography, cardiac catheterization, and cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR).

OBJECTIVE: The schema mode model offers a new conceptualisation of complex dissociative disorders (CDD) as it explains shifts between identities as shifts between schema modes. Furthermore, in this model CDD is conceived as personality pathology, incorporating core features of personality disorders. This study tested the assumptions of this schema mode model of CDD. METHOD: Questionnaires measuring personality disorder traits, schemas, schema modes and coping styles were filled out by patients with CDD, borderline personality disorder and avoidant personality disorder (N?=?210), and their scores on the various constructs were compared. RESULTS: Participants with CDD were characterised by specific schizoid, schizotypal, borderline and avoidant personality traits and early maladaptive schemas in the domains of disconnection and rejection and over-vigilance and inhibition. The most pronounced schema modes were the dysfunctional parent modes, avoidant coping modes and the vulnerable child mode. For coping styles, no differences were found between the diagnostic groups. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION: On all outcome measures participants with CDD scored at the level of personality disorders and showed a unique pattern different from participants with borderline and avoidant personality disorder. This suggests that CDD shows features akin to a personality disorder. A clinical implication is that an adapted form of schema therapy might present a viable treatment option for CDD. © 2023 The Authors.

PURPOSE: During recent years, there has been a growing interest in CSR across disciplines. Various scholars document that Chief Executive Officer (CEO) narcissism is an important factor that should not be overlooked when analyzing CSR. Research on the relationship between CEO narcissism and CSR has treated CSR as a whole construct. However, little attention has been paid to its effect on different dimensions of CSR, especially the same psychological trait may have effects on charitable donations and employee welfare. The purpose of the study is to explore the relationship between CEO narcissism and charitable donations and employee welfare, while taking into account the moderating role of the legal environment. METHODS: This study used the video survey method to measure CEO narcissism, the video information was obtained from Baidu.com and hao.360.com search engines. Other data were collected from Chinese Stock Market Research (CSMAR) database. We used OLS regression for data analysis and also used Tobit regression model to check the robustness of the estimation results. Meanwhile, all analyses will be performed with Stata 16.0 software. RESULTS: Empirical analysis reveals that CEO narcissism has a positive and significant impact on charitable donations and has a negative and significant impact on employee welfare. Moreover, the legal environment will reduce the effect of CEO narcissism on charitable donations and employee welfare, indicating that a stronger legal environment could attenuate the effect of CEO personality traits, especially narcissism on charity donations and employee welfare. CONCLUSION: This study contributes to the behavioral finance theory and stakeholder theory to better understand the relationship between CEO narcissism and charitable donations and employee welfare. Meanwhile, this study is one of the few studies to investigate the patterns of CSR activities in China, an important emerging economy. © 2023 Gao et al.

Purpose: Perfectionism is considered a transdiagnostic construct that characterises eating disorders (EDs) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and that could also depict orthorexia nervosa (ON). The principal aim of this study was to investigate what dimensions of perfectionism mostly represent ON. Moreover, it was evaluated if dieting impacted the presence of orthorexic features and perfectionistic behaviour. Methods: The sample consisted of two groups-the ""Diet"" (n = 93), and the ""No Diet"" (n = 94) groups-composed of people with high and low orthorexic tendencies, respectively. Participants filled out self-report questionnaires to investigate orthorexic tendencies and different facets of perfectionism. Results: Analyses highlighted that people with high orthorexic tendencies showed higher perfectionistic features and that ON had a significant relationship with different facets of perfectionism. No interactions with diet were found. Therefore, no other differences were highlighted when the group type (Diet/No Diet) was considered. Conclusions: Regardless of diet, different facets of perfectionism characterise ON: perfectionism as a personality trait and perfectionism related to EDs and to obsessive-compulsive features. Our results evidenced that perfectionism could also be considered a useful construct in the conceptualization of orthorexia nervosa.

Borderline personality disorders account for 50% of adolescent hospitalization cases in psychiatry. The severity and psychopathological complexity of these symptoms indicate the need for inclusive models of understanding. Adopting a holistic approach allows for the consideration of not only the patient's environment, but also their position within that environment and their life history. In this article, a model based on the concept of therapeutic containment at three levels is presented. Global containment refers to the mindset and organization of the institution that provides care, which is itself a part of society at a specific time. Local containment focuses on understanding and therapeutic interventions within the immediate social environment of the individual. Lastly, individual containment encompasses the development of independent processes during the course of care. These three levels are integrated in the hospital treatment of borderline personality disorders, forming a trans-theoretical approach.

Existing literature on the effects of borderline personality disorder (BPD) and eating disorder (ED) comorbidity in terms of clinical presentation and treatment outcome has been limited and inconclusive. The present study examined whether clients with EDs and varying levels of BPD symptoms presented with more severe ED symptoms at admission, and whether they responded to dialectical behavior therapy (DBT)-based treatment. Participants (N = 176) were adults in a DBT-based partial hospitalization program for EDs at an academic medical center. Participants completed self-report measures at admission, 1-month postadmission, discharge, and 6-month follow-up. Results suggested that patients with elevated BPD symptoms at admission had greater ED symptoms during treatment, evidenced by small to moderate effect sizes. However, patients with high BPD symptoms demonstrated steeper declines in binge eating, fasting, and parasuicidal behavior early during treatment compared to patients with low BPD symptoms. Individuals with high BPD symptoms at admission (i.e., probable BPD diagnosis) were as likely to meet remission criteria and relapse as individuals with low BPD symptoms, though this null finding may be influenced by small cell sizes. Our findings also suggest that DBT skills use does not predict changes in symptoms. In sum, our findings suggest that while clients with higher BPD symptoms may improve during DBT-based partial hospitalization, their ED symptoms may remain more severe. Future studies are needed to determine whether adjunctive treatments improve outcomes for clients with EDs and comorbid BPD symptoms in DBT programs and whether skills use quality is a better predictor of ED symptom changes.

The Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP) is a phenotypic data-driven framework for the classification of psychopathology. We tested the construct and criterion validity of the HiTOP spectra measured by the Personality Inventory for DSM-5 (PID-5) using exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM) and hierarchical regressions both to predict somatic symptom and related disorders (SSRD) and a somatization factor. The case-control study used hierarchical logistic regressions to distinguish 257 cases with SSRD from 1007 healthy controls by both the maladaptive and the temperament factors. The extracted factors were also used in hierarchical linear regressions to predict the dimensional somatization factor. The seven temperament factors explained more variance above and beyond the five maladaptive factors when predicting SSRD (pseudo R2?=?0.169 to 0.266 versus 0.125 to 0.196; change in pseudo R2?=?0.055 to 0.087 versus 0.011 to 0.017). The temperament factors also explained more variance above and beyond the maladaptive factors when predicting the somatization factor (R2?=?0.392 versus 0.269; change in R2?=?0.146 versus 0.023). Although the HiTOP spectra measured by PID-5 are significant structures related to the categorical and dimensional measurements of somatoform, our findings highlight potential problems with both the construct and criterion validity of the HiTOP spectra. © 2023.

BACKGROUND: Proficient speakers of a language often accommodate less proficient speakers during conversation to facilitate comprehension, but information about factors such as personality and language experience that may shape how speakers perceive accommodation is limited. PURPOSE: We developed an online questionnaire to clarify the use of speech accommodation in relation to individual differences in anxiety, personality, and English proficiency. METHOD: Using Qualtrics Panels for recruitment, we surveyed a representative sample of second-language (L2) English speakers (n = 201) and first-language (L1) English speakers (n = 192) across the United States. We report descriptive results in addition to correlations and a factor analysis to assess the perception of accommodation in L2 and L1 speakers. RESULTS: Only a third of L2 participants reported that L1 speakers change their speech when talking to them, and more than half are frustrated when L1 speakers do not accommodate them. Indeed, a majority of our L1 participants reported that they do not change their speech when talking to L2 speakers. For both groups, measures of anxiety, personality, and L2 proficiency modify results, providing novel evidence on factors that influence L2 accommodation. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that L1 speakers accommodate L2 speakers less frequently than previously reported. The data are discussed under communication accommodation theory.

(#)Contributed equally BACKGROUND: Reliable outcome data of psychosomatic inpatient and day hospital treatment with a focus on psychotherapy are important to strengthen ecological validity by assessing the reality of mental health care in the field. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of inpatient and day hospital treatment in German university departments of Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy in a prospective, naturalistic, multicenter design including structured assessments. METHODS: Structured interviews were used to diagnose mental disorders according to ICD-10 and DSM-IV at baseline. Depression, anxiety, somatization, eating disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, as well as personality functioning were assessed by means of questionnaires on admission and at discharge. RESULTS: 2,094 patients recruited by 19 participating university hospitals consented to participation in the study. Effect sizes for each of the outcome criteria were calculated for 4-5 sub-groups per outcome domain with differing severity at baseline. Pre-post effect sizes for patients with moderate and high symptom severity at baseline ranged from d = 0.78 to d = 3.61 with symptoms of PTSD, depression, and anxiety showing the largest and somatization as well as personality functioning showing somewhat smaller effects. CONCLUSIONS: Inpatient and day hospital treatment in German university departments of Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy is effective under field conditions.

BACKGROUND: The short form of the Borderline Symptom List (BSL-23) is a self-rated instrument developed from the initial 95-item German version of the Borderline Symptom List (BSL-95). It is widely used among Chinese adults, but its applicability, factor structure and validity remain uncertain in adolescents. This study aimed to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Chinese Mandarin version of the BSL-23 in a sample of suicidal adolescents. METHODS: The Chinese Mandarin BSL-23 was given to 279 outpatient adolescents with self-injurious thoughts or behaviors. The factor structure, reliability, convergent validity, criterion-related validity and cut-off value were investigated. RESULTS: The Chinese Mandarin version of the BSL-23 demonstrated a one-factor structure and replicated the original version. The scale had high reliability and good test-retest stability. The Chinese Mandarin BSL-23 was correlated with depression, hopelessness, impulsivity, emotional dysregulation, self-esteem, loneliness, childhood trauma and parental bonding patterns evaluated with a variety of scales. The measure showed good criterion-related validity and predictive accuracy (AUC?=?0.87) for self-injurious and suicidal adolescents with borderline personality disorder (BPD) at a cut-off point of 60/61 (mean score 2.60/2.65), with a sensitivity of 0.76 and specificity of 0.83. CONCLUSIONS: The Chinese Mandarin version of the BSL-23 is a reliable and valid self-reported instrument to assess BPD symptomatology among suicidal adolescents. © 2023.

Although multisensory integration (MSI) may have cascading effects on the development of higher-level skills such as socio-communicative functioning, there is a clear lack of understanding of how autistic individuals integrate multiple sensory inputs. Multisensory dynamic information is a more ecological construct than static stimuli, reflecting naturalistic sensory experiences given that our environment involves moving stimulation of more than one sensory modality at a time. In particular, depth movement informs about crucial social (approaching to interact) and non-social (avoiding threats/collisions) information. As autistic characteristics are distributed on a spectrum over clinical and general populations, our work aimed to explore the multisensory integration of depth cues in the autistic personality spectrum, using a go/no-go detection task. The autistic profile of 38 participants from the general population was assessed using questionnaires extensively used in the literature. Participants performed a detection task of auditory and/or visual depth moving stimuli compared to static stimuli. We found that subjects with high-autistic traits overreacted to depth movement and exhibited faster reaction times to audiovisual cues, particularly when the audiovisual stimuli were looming and/or were presented at a fast speed. These results provide evidence of sensory particularities in people with high-autistic traits and suggest that low-level stages of multisensory integration could operate differently all along the autistic personality spectrum.

Personality disorders (PDs) are associated with high levels of societal costs, regardless of whether a single PD or a broad range of PDs have been studied. However, research on the relative contribution of specific PD-types on societal costs is limited. The aim of this study was to explore the possible contributions of the individual DSM-5 categories of PDs on the level of societal costs and its components (health service costs and productivity loss), while controlling for the impact of comorbid mental health and substance use disorders on these outcomes. Participants (n?=?798) were retrieved from the quality register of the Norwegian Network for Personality Disorders-a collaboration of PD-treatment units within specialist mental health services. The patients were referred to treatment in the time-period 2017-2020. Costs were assessed using a structured interview covering the 6-month period prior to assessment. Diagnoses were determined by semi-structured diagnostic interviews (SCID-5-PD and M.I.N.I.). Statistics included multiple regression analyses. The main result was that no specific PD had a unique contribution to the high level of societal costs generally found among treatment-seeking patients with PDs. Borderline PD (BPD) was the only PD with significantly higher health service costs than the other PDs, while BPD, avoidant PD, and unspecified PD were independently associated with enhanced productivity loss. The differential cost-effects of specific PDs on the cost components were small. Several comorbid mental health and substance use disorders were significant contributors to costs, irrespective of PD status. The results underscore the importance of developing and implementing effective treatments for a broader range of PDs, to reduce the high levels of societal costs associated with all PDs. © 2023.

Gambling disorders are a serious public health problem. This manuscript will provide a comprehensive overview on this topic. Gambling disorder involves repeated patterns of gambling behaviors, that result in significant distress or impairment in a person's interpersonal relationships, employment, educational/career opportunities, and finances over a period of 12 months. Gambling is defined as an activity that involves risking something of value with the hopes of acquiring something of greater value. Comparable to substance use disorders, individuals with a gambling disorder may be unsuccessful in exercising control over their problematic behavior, engage in the behavior despite negative consequences, and have preoccupations/cravings to gamble. Gambling disorder has higher comorbidity rates of mental disorders including depression, anxiety, substance use, and personality disorders. Gamblers rarely seek treatment. Treatments must be tailored to the individual which may include psychological interventions, cognitive behavioral therapy, gamblers anonymous, and psychopharmacological agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, mood stabilizers, and opioid antagonists to treat clinical symptoms.

Objective: Personality disorders are serious psychiatric conditions, and some studies have examined neurofeedback training as a potential alternative treatment to improve cognitive and clinical symptoms in patients with such disorders. Here, we aimed to provide a first systematic review of such trials and present existing evidence regarding this treatment for individuals with personality disorders. Method : A systematic search of peer-reviewed English journal articles was conducted for this study to identify original studies on fMRI and EEG neurofeedback treatment protocols in patients with personality disorders up to January 2023. PubMed, Web of Science, ProQuest, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar databases were queried through the keywords ""neurofeedback,"" ""biofeedback,"" and ""personality disorder,"" as well as their related Mesh synonyms. Results: Totally, five studies were included in our systematic review. Two studies utilized EEG neurofeedback protocols, while three articles used real-time fMRI neurofeedback protocols. The types of studies were non-randomized, not-blinded case reports, case series, and single-arm trials with a high risk of bias. EEG neurofeedback protocols applied more training sessions and reported improvements in patients' neuropsychological and behavioral functions after treatment. Furthermore, fMRI-based neurofeedback studies reported neurophysiological changes, such as a shift in vmPFC-amygdala connectivity, towards healthy states following treatment. Moreover, behavioral symptoms of patients were reported to be improved after fMRI neurofeedback. Conclusion: Neurofeedback studies investigating this therapeutic technique for personality disorders are still very preliminary, and no strict conclusions can be drawn at this time. Therefore, further basic and clinical investigations are required to address several open methodological and technical questions and establish consensus and standardization, which will eventually lead to translational works.

OBJECTIVES: The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is a major human adenovirus (HAdV) replication site in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), yet the prevalence and correlates of HAdV GI infection in this setting have remained poorly recognized, especially among adult HSCT recipients. DESIGN OR METHODS: We retrospectively studied the prevalence and risk factors of HAdV GI-tissue infection in HSCT recipients (73 adults and 15 children) with GI symptoms who underwent GI-tissue biopsy between January-2012 and December-2017. The presence of HAdV in the GI tissues was determined by real-time PCR. RESULTS: HAdV GI-tissue infection was detected in 21 (23.9%) patients, with similar infection rates identified in adults and children. GI-tissue detection was more common at late (>100 days) compared to early times post-transplantation (50% vs. 12.9%, p < .001). The presence of bloody diarrhea, Arab ethnicity (p = .014) and concurrent cytomegalovirus GI-tissue detection (p = .025) were significantly correlated with HAdV GI-tissue infection, while chronic graft versus host disease was of borderline association (p = .055). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal a high rate and new clinical-demographic correlates of HAdV GI-tissue infection in adult and pediatric HSCT recipients with GI symptoms. The findings highlight the need for future prospective studies to assess the relatedness of HAdV infection to the GI symptoms, and the prevalence, impact, and treatment of HAdV GI infection in HSCT recipients. © 2023 The Authors.

INTRODUCTION: In recent years, it has been described that the dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota plays a transcendental role in several pathologies. In this sense, the importance of the gut microbiota in the gut-brain axis, with a bidirectional communication, has been demonstrated. Furthermore, the gut microbiota has been linked with mood disorders and neuropsychiatric disorders. METHODS: A systematic review of two databases - PubMed and Scopus - was carried out following PRISMA guidelines. We included original studies in humans with a control group published in the last 11?years, which were assessed by the Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) to confirm their quality. Eighteen articles met all the selection criteria. RESULTS: A review of the articles revealed an association between psychiatric disorders and different bacterial phyla. The studies we have reviewed have demonstrated differences between subjects with psychiatric disorders and controls and highlight a clear relationship between depression, stress, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), psychotic episodes, eating disorders, anxiety and brain function and the gut microbiota composition. CONCLUSION: A reduction of fermentative taxa has been observed in different psychiatric disorders, resulting in a decrease in the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and an increase in pro-inflammatory taxa, both of which may be consequences of the exacerbation of these pathologies.

BACKGROUND: Morningness (morning-eveningness preference or chronotypes) and personality can be both associated with well-being, but few studies have directly compared these two constructs as correlates of well-being. Thus, the first purpose of this study was to test the effects of interactions between stable personality traits (temperaments) and morningness on well-being. Furthermore, personality factors are often composed of both stable biological factors (temperament) and socio-cultural factors (character), and little is known about personality interplay of temperament and character factors with respect to morningness and well-being. The second purpose of this study was therefore to examine the sequential mediating effects of temperament and character factors on the relationship between morningness and well-being. METHODS: The Composite Scale of Morningness, the Korean version of the Temperament and Character Inventory-Revised Short Version (TCI-RS), and the Satisfaction with Life Scale were used to measure morningness, personality dimensions, and well-being, respectively, in 287 Korean university students. Moderating and sequentially mediating effects of temperament and character traits were determined using Hayes' PROCESS macro in SPSS after controlling for sex and age. RESULTS: First, novelty-seeking (NS) and persistence (PS) temperaments have demonstrated the moderating effect in the association between morningness and well-being. The positive effects of morningness on life satisfaction increased with lower NS and PS, respectively. However, other temperaments such as harm avoidance (HA) and reward dependence (RD) have not shown the moderation in the relationship between morningness on well-being. Second, HA temperament and self-directedness (SD) character sequentially mediated the relationship between morningness and well-being. The combination of low scores of HA and high scores of SD have shown the positive effect on the relationship between morningness and well-being. DISCUSSION: This study demonstrated that both the interactions between temperaments and morningness, and combination of specific TCI-RS temperament and character traits play important roles in influencing the association between morningness and well-being. The significance of the mature SD character and its implications for well-being are discussed with limitation of the present study. © 2023 Lee et al.

Intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are the most common developmental disorders in humans. Combined, they affect between 3% and 5% of the population. Although high-throughput genomic methods are rapidly increasing the pool of ASD genes, many cases remain idiopathic. AGO1 is one of the less-known genes related to ID/ASD. This gene encodes a core member protein of the RNA-induced silencing complex, which suppresses mRNA expression through cleavage, degradation, and/or translational repression. Generally, patients with defects in the AGO1 gene manifest varying degrees of ID, speech delay, and autistic behaviors. Herein, we used whole-exome sequencing (WES) to investigate an Iranian family with two affected members one of whom manifested ID and autism and the other showed borderline ID and schizophrenia. WES analysis identified a novel heterozygous truncating variant (NM_012199.5:c.1298G > A, p.Trp433Ter) in the AGO1 gene that co-segregated with the phenotypes using Sanger sequencing. Moreover, the structural analysis showed that due to this variant, two critical domains (Mid and PIWI) of the AGO1 protein have been lost, which has a detrimental effect on the protein's function and structure. To the best of our knowledge, schizophrenia has not been reported in patients with AGO1 deficiency, which is a novel phenotypic finding that expands the AGO1-related behavioral disorders. Moreover, this study's findings determined that patients with the same variant in the AGO1 gene may show heterogeneity in manifested phenotypes. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/University College London.

BACKGROUND: Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) is a prevalent autoimmune disease of thyroid gland with a shared immunological mechanism with mood disorders. Affective temperament (AT) is a biologically determined personality trait that has been linked to mood disorders. The aim of this study was to examine the association between dominant AT and levels of psychosomatic symptoms in women newly diagnosed with HT in comparison to clinically healthy subjects. METHODS: The observational cross-sectional study with nested case control study was involving 146 consecutive participants, who were divided into three groups. The two study groups consisted of women with HT (73), including 49 with hypothyroid HT and 24 with euthyroid HT, and the third group was a control group of healthy participants (73). The Serbian version of the TEMPS-A was utilized to assess AT, while the 4DSQ was used to measure psychosomatic symptoms. RESULTS: The results showed that hyperthymic AT was dominant in all examined groups. The groups with HT differed from the control group in terms of depressive and cyclothymic AT. Furthermore, the study found higher levels of psychosomatic symptoms in the group with HT compared to the control group, with significant differences in distress (p = 0.005) and somatization (p = 0.023) levels. All AT was associated with levels of psychosomatic symptoms in subjects with hypothyroid HT. In contrast, in subjects with euthyroid HT, the association was only found between depressive and cyclothymic AT with distress and depression levels, as well as between somatization and cyclothymic AT. No association was found between AT and anxiety levels in subjects with euthyroid HT. CONCLUSION: The research found differences between study groups in the association between AT and levels of psychosomatic symptoms. Further research with a larger sample size is necessary to more clearly define the associations between affective temperaments and psychosomatic symptoms in women with euthyroid and hypothyroid HT.

It typically causes systolic dysfunction of the left ventricle (LV). Perhaps what is of most significance is the reversible nature of TTS, with many patients achieving recovery within a few weeks to months. TTS can be referred to by other names, attributed to its various precipitants, as well as the structural manifestations of the syndrome. Physical and emotional stressors have been identified as the most common of causes, hence the terms 'stress cardiomyopathy' and 'broken heart syndrome'. Precipitants can range from psychological, and hormonal, to molecular mechanisms. The symptoms of TTS can coalesce with other conditions and hence give rise to many differential diagnoses. Most patients present with dyspnoea and chest pain. The latter also presents in acute coronary syndrome (ACS); thus, ACS is a common differential diagnosis for TTS. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic saw a drastic increase in mental health concerns which have persisted beyond this period. Further studies into personality disorders and their potential predisposition to COVID-19 and thus TTS would advance our understanding of the neuropsychiatric triggers of TTS. There is also a need for a single sensitive and specific diagnostic test for TTS as its diagnosis relies on the culmination of clinical presentation, echocardiography, cardiac catheterization, and cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR).

PURPOSE: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) and eating disorders are highly comorbid, but the shared course of symptoms and associated risks remain poorly understood. The aim of this study was to examine joint symptom trajectories, temporal precedence, risk factors, and population attributable fractions (PAFs) in a community sample of adolescents, using a developmental psychopathology and psychosocial framework. METHODS: Across five years (age 14-18 years), adolescents (n = 544, 56% girls) reported on BPD features and disordered eating behavior. Sociodemographic, interpersonal, and clinical risks were assessed in childhood (age 10-13 years). We used a person-centered approach to examine latent class growth analyses, joint trajectory models, and calculated PAFs. RESULTS: Three-class solutions were found for both disordered eating and BPD features (low, moderate, high), creating nine joint trajectories. High levels of disordered eating were a stronger indicator of high levels of BPD features than was the reverse. Girls and LGBTQ+ youth were most likely to be in a high symptom trajectory. Bullying perpetration and clinical hyperactivity were unique risks for BPD features. Bullying victimization contributed the largest PAF to disordered eating and BPD features. CONCLUSION: We identified several novel and clinically relevant findings related to temporality, risks, screening, and the treatment of adolescent eating problems and BPD.

Transdiagnostic approaches to psychopathology have postulated that factors related to perceived control are particularly relevant to mental health. Here we focused on a specific perceived control-related construct: metacognitive beliefs about uncontrollability. Evidence suggests that dysfunctional metacognitive beliefs play a role in the activation and maintenance of maladaptive emotion regulation strategies and emotional distress. Metacognitive beliefs about the uncontrollability and danger of worry are the most strongly associated with psychopathology. In this multi-study research, we hypothesized that metacognitive beliefs about uncontrollability make a specific contribution to emotion regulation strategies and clinical symptoms. We tested our hypotheses in four different studies, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally (N?=?2224). Participants completed measures of metacognitive beliefs, maladaptive strategies (e.g., worry, thought suppression), and clinical symptoms (e.g., generalized anxiety, emotional distress, depressive and anxiety symptoms). Our results showed that uncontrollability beliefs were the strongest variable associated with maladaptive emotion regulation strategies and clinical symptoms (cross-sectionally), and the only ones that predicted them in the long term. We discuss the theoretical and clinical implications of these results in the light of the metacognitive model and control-related theories. Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier B.V.

OBJECTIVE: This study examined whether phenotypic correlations between psychopathological dimensions and personality traits of different hierarchical levels originate from common genetic and environmental sources of variance. METHOD: Participants were 386 monozygotic and 204 dizygotic twins. The Psychiatric Diagnostic Screening Questionnaire (PDSQ) was applied along with the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R). The results of the CFA confirmed the hypothesis of the internalizing and externalizing dimensions underlying PDSQ scales. RESULTS: The results indicated a significantly greater role of genetic compared to environmental factors in the relationship between internalizing psychopathology and personality traits. Facets of neuroticism showed positive genetic links with internalizing disorders, while negative genetic links were shown for all facets of extraversion except excitement-seeking, competence, self-discipline, achievement striving, actions, and trust. Lower-order personality traits were shown to be associated with internalizing disorders more intensively than the broader domains to which they belong, both at the phenotypic and genetic levels. CONCLUSIONS: High neuroticism, together with several facets from the domain of extraversion and conscientiousness seems to represent an increased genetic susceptibility to the disorders from the internalizing spectrum. Results also suggest that specific environmental factors which are not shared with personality traits contribute to the internalizing symptoms. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Existing literature on the effects of borderline personality disorder (BPD) and eating disorder (ED) comorbidity in terms of clinical presentation and treatment outcome has been limited and inconclusive. The present study examined whether clients with EDs and varying levels of BPD symptoms presented with more severe ED symptoms at admission, and whether they responded to dialectical behavior therapy (DBT)-based treatment. Participants (N = 176) were adults in a DBT-based partial hospitalization program for EDs at an academic medical center. Participants completed self-report measures at admission, 1-month postadmission, discharge, and 6-month follow-up. Results suggested that patients with elevated BPD symptoms at admission had greater ED symptoms during treatment, evidenced by small to moderate effect sizes. However, patients with high BPD symptoms demonstrated steeper declines in binge eating, fasting, and parasuicidal behavior early during treatment compared to patients with low BPD symptoms. Individuals with high BPD symptoms at admission (i.e., probable BPD diagnosis) were as likely to meet remission criteria and relapse as individuals with low BPD symptoms, though this null finding may be influenced by small cell sizes. Our findings also suggest that DBT skills use does not predict changes in symptoms. In sum, our findings suggest that while clients with higher BPD symptoms may improve during DBT-based partial hospitalization, their ED symptoms may remain more severe. Future studies are needed to determine whether adjunctive treatments improve outcomes for clients with EDs and comorbid BPD symptoms in DBT programs and whether skills use quality is a better predictor of ED symptom changes.

BACKGROUND: The concepts of Dark Triad and Psychological Capital (PsyCap) have been extensively researched separately, but until one recent study, their interrelation has not been investigated. Purpose of this study was to uncover differences of the relationship of both concepts across work related industries. METHODS: In total, 2,109 German employees across 11 industries completed a questionnaire on Dark Triad (narcissism, psychopathy and Machiavellianism) and PsyCap. Multiple regression analyses were used to test the association of both concepts across industries. RESULTS: Values of narcissism, psychopathy and PsyCap generally differed between industries. No significant differences were found for Machiavellianism. While narcissism relates positively to PsyCap in all industry sectors, psychopathy only showed a negative relation to PsyCap in some sectors. For industries architecture, automotive and consulting, psychopathy did not significantly predict PsyCap. CONCLUSIONS: We argue that different expectations of employees per industry make it easier or harder for different personalities to assimilate (homogeneity hypothesis) to the work context (measured by PsyCap). Future studies should investigate this further with other variables such as person-organization-fit. This study was, however, the first to simultaneously investigate Dark Triad and PsyCap among employees and their respective industry. It extends previous findings by revealing differences of both concepts across and within industry sectors. The study can help to reconsider in which industries Dark Triad personality affects PsyCap as antecedent of workplace outcomes such as work satisfaction or job performance. © 2023.

IMPORTANCE: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is an important risk factor of suicidal behavior, but the added burden of suicidal behavior and MDD on the patient and societal level, including all-cause mortality, is not well studied. Also, the contribution of various prognostic factors for suicidal behavior has not been quantified in larger samples. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical and societal outcomes, including all-cause mortality, of suicidal behavior in patients with MDD and to explore associated risk factors and clinical management to inform future research and guidelines. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This population-based cohort study used health care data from the Stockholm MDD Cohort. Patients aged 18 years or older with episodes of MDD diagnosed between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2017, in any health care setting were included. The dates of the data analysis were February 1 to November 1, 2022. EXPOSURES: Patients with MDD with and without records of suicidal behavior. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were comorbid conditions, medications, health care resource utilization (HCRU), and work loss. Using Region Stockholm registry variables, a risk score for factors associated with suicidal behavior within 1 year after the start of an MDD episode was calculated. RESULTS: A total of 158?169 unipolar MDD episodes were identified in 145?577 patients; 2240 (1.4%) of these episodes, in 2219 patients, included records of suicidal behavior (mean [SD] patient age, 40.9 [18.6] years; 1415 episodes [63.2%] in women and 825 [36.8%] in men). A total of 11?109 MDD episodes in 9574 matched patients with MDD without records of suicidal behavior were included as controls (mean [SD] patient age, 40.8 [18.5] years; 7046 episodes [63.4%] in women and 4063 [36.6%] in men). The all-cause mortality rate was 2.5 per 100 person-years at risk for the MDD-SB group and 1.0 per 100 person-years at risk for the MDD-non-SB group, based on 466 deaths. Suicidal behavior was associated with higher all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 2.62 [95% CI, 2.15-3.20]), as well as with HCRU and work loss, compared with the matched controls. Patients with MDD and suicidal behavior were younger and more prone to have psychiatric comorbid conditions, such as personality disorders, substance use, and anxiety, at the start of their episode. The most important factors associated with suicidal behavior within 1 year after the start of an MDD episode were history of suicidal behavior and age, history of substance use and sleep disorders, and care setting in which MDD was diagnosed. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study's findings suggest that high mortality, morbidity, HCRU, and work loss associated with MDD may be substantially accentuated in patients with MDD and suicidal behavior. Use of medication aimed at decreasing the risk of all-cause mortality during MDD episodes should be systematically evaluated to improve long-term outcomes.

AIM: To evaluate predisposition to eating disorders (ED) or body dissatisfaction in adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM); to further investigate any differences in ED predisposition between subjects with T1DM on multiple daily injections (MDI) or insulin pumps (CSII) and in respect to control healthy subjects. METHODS: We conducted a monocentric, cross-sectional, observational study. We enrolled subjects with T1DM, aged ?18 years, and healthy subjects (HS) as control group. All participants completed two questionnaires to detect possible predisposition to ED: 34-items Body Shape Questionnaire (BSQ) and Eating Disorder Inventory-3 (EDI-3). HS only filled BSQ. For subjects with T1DM data about glycated hemoglobin and duration of disease were also collected. RESULTS: 162 subjects with T1DM (age 41±12 years, 77 [47%] males) and 50 HS (age 38±13 years, 18 (36%) males) were enrolled. 87 subjects with T1DM (54%) were on MDI and 75 (46%) were on CSII. No significant difference in the distribution of BSQ scores between subjects with T1DM and HS was observed (p = 0.551), although 16% of subjects with T1DM scored BSQ class 1 points while 8% of HS scored a BSQ class 1 points. No significant difference in BSQ scores was observed between subjects with T1DM on MDI or CSII. Between these two groups, no differences in EDI-3 scores were observed except for perfectionism score: subjects on MDI present more frequently a predisposition for perfectionism (p<0.05) and, at a trend level, for bulimia. CONCLUSION: A non -significant higher percentage of BSQ class 1 was detected in subjects T1DM compared to healthy controls. Among subjects with T1DM, no differences between MDI and CSII were observed in ED predisposition. A more perfectionist personality has been detected among subjects on MDI. Copyright © 2023.

BACKGROUND: The concepts of Dark Triad and Psychological Capital (PsyCap) have been extensively researched separately, but until one recent study, their interrelation has not been investigated. Purpose of this study was to uncover differences of the relationship of both concepts across work related industries. METHODS: In total, 2,109 German employees across 11 industries completed a questionnaire on Dark Triad (narcissism, psychopathy and Machiavellianism) and PsyCap. Multiple regression analyses were used to test the association of both concepts across industries. RESULTS: Values of narcissism, psychopathy and PsyCap generally differed between industries. No significant differences were found for Machiavellianism. While narcissism relates positively to PsyCap in all industry sectors, psychopathy only showed a negative relation to PsyCap in some sectors. For industries architecture, automotive and consulting, psychopathy did not significantly predict PsyCap. CONCLUSIONS: We argue that different expectations of employees per industry make it easier or harder for different personalities to assimilate (homogeneity hypothesis) to the work context (measured by PsyCap). Future studies should investigate this further with other variables such as person-organization-fit. This study was, however, the first to simultaneously investigate Dark Triad and PsyCap among employees and their respective industry. It extends previous findings by revealing differences of both concepts across and within industry sectors. The study can help to reconsider in which industries Dark Triad personality affects PsyCap as antecedent of workplace outcomes such as work satisfaction or job performance. © 2023.

INTRODUCTION: According to the literature, early initiation to cannabis use and a dependent pattern of use are important risk factors for the development of mental health disorders. However, there are few cohort studies which look at the development of mental health disorders associated with cannabis use among young people with cannabis use disorder (CUD). The aim of the study was to determine the cumulative incidence of mental health disorders and the risk of developing mental health disorders among minors who commenced treatment for CUD in Catalonia during 2015-2019. METHODS: This was a retrospective fixed cohort study, matched for confounding variables, based on data from the Catalan Health Surveillance System. The exposed cohort comprised young people who entered treatment for CUD during 2015-2019 (n = 948) and who were minors on the date of commencing treatment. Matching was done with a paired cohort (n = 4,737), according to confounding variables. Individuals with a diagnosis of a mental health disorder prior to the study period were excluded. The cumulative incidence was calculated for mental health disorders for the exposed and the paired cohorts and stratified by type of mental disorder. Incidence rate ratios were estimated using the conditional Poisson model with robust variance, stratified by sex. RESULTS: The cumulative incidence for development of a mental health disorder was 19.6% in the exposed cohort and 3.1% in the paired cohort; with higher incidence among females (females 32.7%; males 15.8%). The exposed cohort had an 8.7 times increased risk of developing a mental health disorder than the paired cohort. The most frequent diagnoses were reaction to severe stress, adjustment disorder, and personality disorders. CONCLUSION: This study confirmed that the exposed cohort was at increased risk of developing mental health disorders compared to the paired cohort. To date, few studies have analyzed the association between cannabis use and the development of mental health disorders, considering cannabis dependence. Further studies should be undertaken considering CUD. In addition, more studies are needed to understand the factors that determine the development of CUD. Further research in these areas would contribute to the design of prevention strategies aimed at those young individuals with a higher risk of developing cannabis dependence and suffering its consequences. © 2023 The Author(s).

This study explores the relationship between bright- and dark-side personality traits and four major styles of defense mechanisms (DMs) as this relationship remains unexplored and important in understanding the DMs. In all, 435 adult working participants (241 men; 194 women; Mean age 46.06 yrs) mainly in middle management jobs, completed a 78-item, six-trait measure of bright-side personality (HPTI: High Potential Type Indicator), a 25-item five-trait measure of the dark-side personality (PID-5;BF: DSM-5-Brief Form) and 88-item, four-styles measure of defense mechanisms (Defense Style Questionnaire). The aim was to examine demographic (sex, age, education), ideological and personality trait correlates of the DMs. It was hypothesized that the dark-side traits, particularly Detachment would be most strongly related to the DMs. Thereafter, a hierarchical linear regression was performed with each DM factor as criterion and predictors being demography, ideology, self-esteem as well as bright- and dark-side personality traits. Detachment was associated with all DMs, particularly Maladaptive (r = 0.68) and Image Distorting Style (r = 0.38) while Conscientiousness was associated with none. One implication concerns the assessment of DMs by standard tests. Limitations are acknowledged and include method invariance and sample homogeneity. Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is complicated by population heterogeneity, motivating the investigation of biotypes through imaging-derived phenotypes. However, neuromorphic heterogeneity in MDD remains unclear, and how the correlated gene expression (CGE) connectome constrains these neuromorphic anomalies in MDD biotypes has not yet been studied. METHODS: Here, we related cortical thickness deviations in MDD biotypes to a pattern of CGE connectome. Cortical thickness was estimated from 3D T1-weighted magnetic resonance images in two independent cohorts (discovery cohort: n = 425; replication cohort: n = 217). The transcriptional activity was measured according to Allen Human Brain Atlas. A density-peak-based clustering algorithm was used to identify MDD biotypes. RESULTS: We found that patients with MDD were clustered into two replicated biotypes based on single-patient regional deviations from healthy controls across two datasets. Biotype 1 exhibited cortical thinning across the whole brain, whereas biotype 2 mainly showed cortical thickening in the brain. Using brain-wide gene expression data, we found that deviations of transcriptionally connected neighbors predicted regional deviation for both biotypes. Furthermore, putative CGE-informed epicenters of biotype 1 were concentrated on the cognitive control circuit, whereas biotype 2 epicenters were located in the social perception circuit. The patterns of epicenter likelihood were associated with depression- and anxiety-response maps, suggesting that epicenters of MDD biotypes may be associated with clinical efficacies. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings linked the CGE connectome and neuromorphic deviations to identify distinct epicenters in MDD biotypes, providing insight into how microscale gene expressions informed MDD biotypes.

IMPORTANCE: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is an important risk factor of suicidal behavior, but the added burden of suicidal behavior and MDD on the patient and societal level, including all-cause mortality, is not well studied. Also, the contribution of various prognostic factors for suicidal behavior has not been quantified in larger samples. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical and societal outcomes, including all-cause mortality, of suicidal behavior in patients with MDD and to explore associated risk factors and clinical management to inform future research and guidelines. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This population-based cohort study used health care data from the Stockholm MDD Cohort. Patients aged 18 years or older with episodes of MDD diagnosed between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2017, in any health care setting were included. The dates of the data analysis were February 1 to November 1, 2022. EXPOSURES: Patients with MDD with and without records of suicidal behavior. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were comorbid conditions, medications, health care resource utilization (HCRU), and work loss. Using Region Stockholm registry variables, a risk score for factors associated with suicidal behavior within 1 year after the start of an MDD episode was calculated. RESULTS: A total of 158?169 unipolar MDD episodes were identified in 145?577 patients; 2240 (1.4%) of these episodes, in 2219 patients, included records of suicidal behavior (mean [SD] patient age, 40.9 [18.6] years; 1415 episodes [63.2%] in women and 825 [36.8%] in men). A total of 11?109 MDD episodes in 9574 matched patients with MDD without records of suicidal behavior were included as controls (mean [SD] patient age, 40.8 [18.5] years; 7046 episodes [63.4%] in women and 4063 [36.6%] in men). The all-cause mortality rate was 2.5 per 100 person-years at risk for the MDD-SB group and 1.0 per 100 person-years at risk for the MDD-non-SB group, based on 466 deaths. Suicidal behavior was associated with higher all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 2.62 [95% CI, 2.15-3.20]), as well as with HCRU and work loss, compared with the matched controls. Patients with MDD and suicidal behavior were younger and more prone to have psychiatric comorbid conditions, such as personality disorders, substance use, and anxiety, at the start of their episode. The most important factors associated with suicidal behavior within 1 year after the start of an MDD episode were history of suicidal behavior and age, history of substance use and sleep disorders, and care setting in which MDD was diagnosed. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study's findings suggest that high mortality, morbidity, HCRU, and work loss associated with MDD may be substantially accentuated in patients with MDD and suicidal behavior. Use of medication aimed at decreasing the risk of all-cause mortality during MDD episodes should be systematically evaluated to improve long-term outcomes.

Objective: Personality disorders are serious psychiatric conditions, and some studies have examined neurofeedback training as a potential alternative treatment to improve cognitive and clinical symptoms in patients with such disorders. Here, we aimed to provide a first systematic review of such trials and present existing evidence regarding this treatment for individuals with personality disorders. Method : A systematic search of peer-reviewed English journal articles was conducted for this study to identify original studies on fMRI and EEG neurofeedback treatment protocols in patients with personality disorders up to January 2023. PubMed, Web of Science, ProQuest, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar databases were queried through the keywords ""neurofeedback,"" ""biofeedback,"" and ""personality disorder,"" as well as their related Mesh synonyms. Results: Totally, five studies were included in our systematic review. Two studies utilized EEG neurofeedback protocols, while three articles used real-time fMRI neurofeedback protocols. The types of studies were non-randomized, not-blinded case reports, case series, and single-arm trials with a high risk of bias. EEG neurofeedback protocols applied more training sessions and reported improvements in patients' neuropsychological and behavioral functions after treatment. Furthermore, fMRI-based neurofeedback studies reported neurophysiological changes, such as a shift in vmPFC-amygdala connectivity, towards healthy states following treatment. Moreover, behavioral symptoms of patients were reported to be improved after fMRI neurofeedback. Conclusion: Neurofeedback studies investigating this therapeutic technique for personality disorders are still very preliminary, and no strict conclusions can be drawn at this time. Therefore, further basic and clinical investigations are required to address several open methodological and technical questions and establish consensus and standardization, which will eventually lead to translational works.

Status pursuit has been emphasized as a key motivational factor underlying narcissism, but research has just begun to unravel the processes by which more narcissistic individuals pursue status in their everyday social interactions. In this article, we combine process models of narcissistic status pursuit with three-factor models of narcissism to test whether different aspects of narcissism (i.e., agentic, antagonistic, and neurotic narcissism) can be characterized by stronger reactivity to different kinds of status perceptions (i.e., the perceived assignment of status, attack on status, and neglect of status). Using data from two experience sampling studies, one involving college students (Nparticipants = 285; Nobservations = 18,036) and one in the general population (Nparticipants = 1,177; Nobservations = 36,074), we first found that the perceived assignment of status, attack on status, and neglect of status were related to status-relevant behaviors (i.e., expressive, combative, and avoidant behaviors) and emotions (e.g., pride, anger, and shame) within persons on average. Next, we found that both mean levels of perceptual, behavioral, and emotional states and status contingencies (i.e., the within-person relationships of status perceptions with behavioral and emotional states) varied considerably across individuals and that these individual differences were reliable and stable across time. Last, we found some associations between trait levels of agentic, antagonistic, and neurotic narcissism and individual differences in mean levels as well as status-emotion contingencies. Our findings emphasize the multifaceted and status-driven nature of narcissism and support the use of theoretically derived contingencies as more dynamic aspects of personality.

Borderline personality disorders account for 50% of adolescent hospitalization cases in psychiatry. The severity and psychopathological complexity of these symptoms indicate the need for inclusive models of understanding. Adopting a holistic approach allows for the consideration of not only the patient's environment, but also their position within that environment and their life history. In this article, a model based on the concept of therapeutic containment at three levels is presented. Global containment refers to the mindset and organization of the institution that provides care, which is itself a part of society at a specific time. Local containment focuses on understanding and therapeutic interventions within the immediate social environment of the individual. Lastly, individual containment encompasses the development of independent processes during the course of care. These three levels are integrated in the hospital treatment of borderline personality disorders, forming a trans-theoretical approach.

This preliminary study aims at extending existing empirical evidence on subtypes of borderline personality disorders (BPDs) by identifying subtypes among patients with BPD, comparing their characteristics to the trait domains of the dimensional model of the International Classification of Diseases, 11th Revision (ICD-11; World Health Organization [WHO], 2022), and examining differences in sociodemographic, clinical, and therapeutic outcome variables. Data of N = 109 patients were subjected to cluster analysis based on the International Personality Disorder Examination variables for BPD and analyzed regarding differences in clinical and therapeutic variables. Clustering suggested a three-cluster solution, namely, internalizing (n = 35), externalizing (n = 28), and mixed subtype (n = 46). Subtypes showed differences in clinical variables and therapeutic outcomes with the internalizing showing more affective disorders and the mixed subtype showing the lowest therapeutic change in borderline-specific symptoms. Together, the present results correspond to the model of the ICD-11 (WHO, 2022). Clinical and treatment implications are being discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved).

Good Psychiatric Management (GPM) is a generalist clinical management approach for borderline personality disorder that incorporates common ingredients of good standard care for any psychiatric diagnosis with what works from prevailing specialist psychotherapies. Similar to all validated therapies for BPD, it relies on a specified formulation of the disorder' symptoms as arising from interpersonal hypersensitivity, to dynamically describe typical patterns of daily self- and interpersonal issues that drive the instability that defines the general personality dysfunction characteristic of the disorder. Recent adaptations of GPM have been proposed for narcissistic personality disorder and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, with development of similar dynamic models for both (intrapsychic coherence model and model of overcontrol). New dimensional models of personality disorder diagnosis have been developed to address limitations of categorical approach, but the incorporation of these models into usage in the delivery of clinical services (where categorical approach remains the most used) is limited. This paper describes an adaptation of GPM to two cases of personality disorder that illustrate the usefulness of GPM models for dynamic representation of complex daily fluctuations in internal psychic coherence and interpersonal functioning. Specialist psychotherapies will never meet the demands of public health needs to treat personality dysfunction, and incorporation of new dimensional models of diagnosis are needed for treatments that can provide a minimal standard of care for providers and patients.

AIM: To evaluate predisposition to eating disorders (ED) or body dissatisfaction in adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM); to further investigate any differences in ED predisposition between subjects with T1DM on multiple daily injections (MDI) or insulin pumps (CSII) and in respect to control healthy subjects. METHODS: We conducted a monocentric, cross-sectional, observational study. We enrolled subjects with T1DM, aged ?18 years, and healthy subjects (HS) as control group. All participants completed two questionnaires to detect possible predisposition to ED: 34-items Body Shape Questionnaire (BSQ) and Eating Disorder Inventory-3 (EDI-3). HS only filled BSQ. For subjects with T1DM data about glycated hemoglobin and duration of disease were also collected. RESULTS: 162 subjects with T1DM (age 41±12 years, 77 [47%] males) and 50 HS (age 38±13 years, 18 (36%) males) were enrolled. 87 subjects with T1DM (54%) were on MDI and 75 (46%) were on CSII. No significant difference in the distribution of BSQ scores between subjects with T1DM and HS was observed (p = 0.551), although 16% of subjects with T1DM scored BSQ class 1 points while 8% of HS scored a BSQ class 1 points. No significant difference in BSQ scores was observed between subjects with T1DM on MDI or CSII. Between these two groups, no differences in EDI-3 scores were observed except for perfectionism score: subjects on MDI present more frequently a predisposition for perfectionism (p<0.05) and, at a trend level, for bulimia. CONCLUSION: A non -significant higher percentage of BSQ class 1 was detected in subjects T1DM compared to healthy controls. Among subjects with T1DM, no differences between MDI and CSII were observed in ED predisposition. A more perfectionist personality has been detected among subjects on MDI. Copyright © 2023.

BACKGROUND: Proficient speakers of a language often accommodate less proficient speakers during conversation to facilitate comprehension, but information about factors such as personality and language experience that may shape how speakers perceive accommodation is limited. PURPOSE: We developed an online questionnaire to clarify the use of speech accommodation in relation to individual differences in anxiety, personality, and English proficiency. METHOD: Using Qualtrics Panels for recruitment, we surveyed a representative sample of second-language (L2) English speakers (n = 201) and first-language (L1) English speakers (n = 192) across the United States. We report descriptive results in addition to correlations and a factor analysis to assess the perception of accommodation in L2 and L1 speakers. RESULTS: Only a third of L2 participants reported that L1 speakers change their speech when talking to them, and more than half are frustrated when L1 speakers do not accommodate them. Indeed, a majority of our L1 participants reported that they do not change their speech when talking to L2 speakers. For both groups, measures of anxiety, personality, and L2 proficiency modify results, providing novel evidence on factors that influence L2 accommodation. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that L1 speakers accommodate L2 speakers less frequently than previously reported. The data are discussed under communication accommodation theory.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Antileucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 (anti-LGI1) autoimmune encephalitis was first described in 2010 and is today the most common type of limbic encephalitis. During the course of the disease, 60%-88% of the patients develop hyponatremia. The etiology of the sodium disorder is unclear, often presumed to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). Other electrolyte abnormalities have not been reported in association with anti-LGI1 antibody encephalitis. Due to the presence of hypomagnesemia and hypophosphatemia in our patients, we set out to try to find the expression of LGI1 protein in the kidney as an explanation for these abnormalities. METHODS: We reviewed the medical files of all patients diagnosed with anti-LGI1 antibody encephalitis, at the Department of Neurology in the Tel Aviv Medical Center between January 2011 and December 2020, exploring for electrolyte abnormalities. Using tissue staining, Western blot, mass spectrometry, and RNA expression techniques, we tried to demonstrate the expression of LGI1 protein in the human kidney. RESULTS: We identified 15 patients diagnosed with anti-LGI1 antibody encephalitis. Their average age was 65 years (44-80), and 9 were male individuals. Thirteen of the 15 patients (87%) developed varying degrees of hyponatremia. Laboratory studies demonstrated low serum osmolality, low serum blood urea nitrogen, and low uric acid, with a high urinary sodium and inappropriately high urine osmolality, supporting the presumable diagnosis of SIADH. One patient with hyponatremia that was tested, had high levels of copeptin, supporting the diagnosis of SIADH. In addition to hyponatremia, 7 patients (47%) exhibited other electrolyte abnormalities; 5 patients (33%) had overt hypophosphatemia, 4 patients (27%) had overt hypomagnesemia, and 2 other patients (13%) had borderline low magnesium levels. Western blot analysis of human kidney lysate, mass spectrometry, and qRT-PCR failed to demonstrate the expression of LGI1 protein in the kidney. DISCUSSION: Hyponatremia in patients with anti-LGI1 antibody encephalitis is due to SIADH as previously assumed. Other electrolyte abnormalities such as hypomagnesemia and hypophosphatemia occur in at least 40% of patients and may be another clue for the diagnosis of anti-LGI1 antibody encephalitis. Because we failed to demonstrate LGI1 expression in the kidney, the results of our study suggest that renal losses lead to these disturbances, most probably due to SIADH.

METHODS: Participants with probable RBD (pRBD) were defined using the RBD Questionnaire-Hong Kong (RBDQ-HK). Controls were collected by matching age and sex. Demographic information, lifestyle, comorbidity, prodromal symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD), and blood biomarkers were assessed. The associations between these factors and pRBD were investigated by logistic regression. Partial correlation analysis was used to assess the association between the severity of RBD and depression. RESULTS: A total of 278 pRBD participants (age = 58.31 ± 15.82 years) and 556 controls (age = 58.16 ± 15.84 years) were enrolled in this study. Patients with pRBD were more likely to be current alcohol drinkers (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.0-2.32). Participants with pRBD had a higher Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) score (OR 1.17, 95% CI 1.11-1.22) than controls and were more likely to report arthritis (OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.08-2.16), constipation (OR 1.93, 95% CI 1.31-2.86), hyposmia (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.10-2.67), and depression (OR 3.15, 95% CI 2.17-4.58). Higher levels of total cholesterol (OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.99-1.33) and low-density lipoprotein (OR 1.21, 95% CI 0.99-1.47) had borderline associations with pRBD. Additionally, the severity of pRBD was positively related to depression (r = 0.31, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: We determined several risk factors for pRBD in this case-control study. Future studies are needed to understand the mechanism underlying the association between these factors and pRBD. Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

PURPOSE: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) and eating disorders are highly comorbid, but the shared course of symptoms and associated risks remain poorly understood. The aim of this study was to examine joint symptom trajectories, temporal precedence, risk factors, and population attributable fractions (PAFs) in a community sample of adolescents, using a developmental psychopathology and psychosocial framework. METHODS: Across five years (age 14-18 years), adolescents (n = 544, 56% girls) reported on BPD features and disordered eating behavior. Sociodemographic, interpersonal, and clinical risks were assessed in childhood (age 10-13 years). We used a person-centered approach to examine latent class growth analyses, joint trajectory models, and calculated PAFs. RESULTS: Three-class solutions were found for both disordered eating and BPD features (low, moderate, high), creating nine joint trajectories. High levels of disordered eating were a stronger indicator of high levels of BPD features than was the reverse. Girls and LGBTQ+ youth were most likely to be in a high symptom trajectory. Bullying perpetration and clinical hyperactivity were unique risks for BPD features. Bullying victimization contributed the largest PAF to disordered eating and BPD features. CONCLUSION: We identified several novel and clinically relevant findings related to temporality, risks, screening, and the treatment of adolescent eating problems and BPD.

Transdiagnostic approaches to psychopathology have postulated that factors related to perceived control are particularly relevant to mental health. Here we focused on a specific perceived control-related construct: metacognitive beliefs about uncontrollability. Evidence suggests that dysfunctional metacognitive beliefs play a role in the activation and maintenance of maladaptive emotion regulation strategies and emotional distress. Metacognitive beliefs about the uncontrollability and danger of worry are the most strongly associated with psychopathology. In this multi-study research, we hypothesized that metacognitive beliefs about uncontrollability make a specific contribution to emotion regulation strategies and clinical symptoms. We tested our hypotheses in four different studies, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally (N?=?2224). Participants completed measures of metacognitive beliefs, maladaptive strategies (e.g., worry, thought suppression), and clinical symptoms (e.g., generalized anxiety, emotional distress, depressive and anxiety symptoms). Our results showed that uncontrollability beliefs were the strongest variable associated with maladaptive emotion regulation strategies and clinical symptoms (cross-sectionally), and the only ones that predicted them in the long term. We discuss the theoretical and clinical implications of these results in the light of the metacognitive model and control-related theories. Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Legionellosis among welders and other metalworkers is a rare but potentially underappreciated occupational hazard. The same mechanisms that predispose welders to severe pneumonia from Streptococcus pneumoniae and Bacillus cereus may similarly predispose them to Legionella pneumophila infection. We present a case of a previously healthy, immunocompetent 31-year-old male welder presenting with three days of shortness of breath, hypoxia, high-grade fever, and blood-tinged sputum. Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a lobar consolidation of the right middle and lower lobes. Laboratory evaluation showed borderline hyponatremia, hypophosphatemia, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient was ultimately intubated and started on broad-spectrum antibiotics. Multiple respiratory cultures were negative and Legionella urine antigen testing was also negative. Eventually, bronchial Legionella culture was positive for Legionella pneumophila, and a blood next-generation sequencing test also confirmed the diagnosis. He was extubated six days following admission and subsequently discharged. Copyright © 2023, McBee et al.

" (1)Eating Disorders Center, Department of Neuroscience ""Rita Levi Montalcini"", University of Turin, Via Cherasco 11, 10126 Turin, Italy. Reduction in food intake is an important feature of eating disorders (EDs). However, whereas self-reported cognitive control over food (i.e., dietary restraint) is commonly assessed, we are not aware of any study evaluating the actual reduction in caloric intake (i.e., caloric restriction, CR) and its relationships with psychopathological, clinical, and anamnestic factors in individuals with EDs. In this study, we quantified caloric intake, CR, and weight suppression in 225 ED inpatients and explored significant relationships with self-reported eating symptoms, body dissatisfaction, body avoidance, personality, and affective symptoms. For underweight inpatients (n = 192), baseline predictors of caloric intake and restriction at discharge were assessed through a data-driven approach. CR at admission was significantly related to eating symptomatology, state anxiety, and body image. In regression models, CR, higher BMI, binge-purging symptoms, and the interaction between weight suppression and CR were significantly related to body dissatisfaction. The best psychopathological predictors of caloric intake and restriction at discharge for underweight inpatients were perfectionistic concern over mistakes and state anxiety. These results suggest that caloric restriction is associated to relevant ED features and warrant for a multidimensional assessment of ED psychopathology.

OBJECTIVE: Negative urgency (NU) and distress tolerance (DT) are two similar yet distinct constructs with putative transdiagnostic relevance, particularly across psychopathology characterized by impulsivity (e.g., substance use disorders [SUD], eating disorders featuring binging and/or purging ED-B/P, and borderline personality disorder [BPD]). Yet, there remains a lack of research into NU and DT across SUD, ED-B/P, and BPD symptomatology in clinical populations. The present study sought to elucidate the transdiagnostic utility of NU and DT across impulsive-type psychology by examining the unique and interactive roles of NU and DT across SUD, ED-B/P, and BPD symptomatology within a treatment-seeking sample of young people. METHOD: Participants (N?=?385; 62.3% female; aged 16-25 years) were recruited from youth health services across Melbourne, Australia. Participants completed an online survey including self-report measures of NU and DT as well as SUD, ED-B/P, and BPD symptoms. Mixed effects logistic regression was used to explore unique and interactive associations of NU and DT with symptoms. RESULTS: Both NU (adjusted odds ratio [ORadj ]?=?1.22; 95% confidence interval [CI]?=?[1.16, 1.28]) and global DT (ORadj ?=?0.59; 95% CI?=?[0.47, 0.74]) uniquely predicted symptoms. However, associations with global DT and most of its components differed across psychopathology types. No significant interactions between NU and DT in predicting symptoms were found. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the transdiagnostic utility of NU across SUD, ED-B/P, and BPD, while suggesting the role of DT across these disorders is more nuanced. These findings have important implications for NU and DT as potential intervention targets. © 2023 The Authors. Journal of Clinical Psychology published by Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Gambling disorders are a serious public health problem. This manuscript will provide a comprehensive overview on this topic. Gambling disorder involves repeated patterns of gambling behaviors, that result in significant distress or impairment in a person's interpersonal relationships, employment, educational/career opportunities, and finances over a period of 12 months. Gambling is defined as an activity that involves risking something of value with the hopes of acquiring something of greater value. Comparable to substance use disorders, individuals with a gambling disorder may be unsuccessful in exercising control over their problematic behavior, engage in the behavior despite negative consequences, and have preoccupations/cravings to gamble. Gambling disorder has higher comorbidity rates of mental disorders including depression, anxiety, substance use, and personality disorders. Gamblers rarely seek treatment. Treatments must be tailored to the individual which may include psychological interventions, cognitive behavioral therapy, gamblers anonymous, and psychopharmacological agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, mood stabilizers, and opioid antagonists to treat clinical symptoms.

Aripiprazole is an atypical antipsychotic medication, and its use in treating borderline personality disorder (BPD) is debatable because it is not FDA-approved for treating BPD. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of aripiprazole in patients with BPD. On July 2, 2021, the protocol (CRD42021256647) was registered in PROSPERO. PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Ovid-Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and Cochrane (CENTRAL) were searched without regard for language or publication date. We also searched trial registries on ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. Randomized clinical trials with adult patients diagnosed with BPD met the inclusion criteria. The Cochrane risk of bias for randomized trials (RoB-2) method was used to assess the quality of the included studies. We included two previously published randomized clinical trials. There were 76 patients with BPD, with 38, 12, and 26 assigned to the aripiprazole, olanzapine, and placebo groups, respectively. Most patients (88.16%) were females, with ages ranging from 22.1 to 28.14 yr. Aripiprazole has been proven to reduce anxiety, depression, anger, hostility, clinical severity, and obsessive-compulsive behavior, insecurity, melancholy, anxiety, aggressiveness/hostility, phobic anxiety, paranoid thinking, psychoticism, and somatization. The adverse effects were headache, insomnia, restlessness, tremor, and akathisia. The risk of bias was considerable in both trials, which is somewhat problematic considering that prejudice can lead to incorrect outcomes and conclusions. Aripiprazole has demonstrated encouraging outcomes in the treatment of patients with BPD. More randomized controlled studies are needed. © 2023.

(#)Contributed equally PURPOSE: Patients with central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) have previously been shown to have a lower heart rate variability (HRV), implying a lower vagal tone. Vagal tone alters mineralocorticoids, which in turn affect the thickness of the choroid. Since increased choroidal thickness is characteristic of CSC, we wanted to investigate its correlation with HRV. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this case-control study, 21 acute CSC patients and 31 healthy controls were included. Diagnosis was confirmed by optical coherence tomography (OCT) and retinal examination. HRV was evaluated following accepted standards. Outcome measures were chosen beforehand as follows: Standard deviation of N-N intervals (SDNN), root mean square of successive differences (RMSDD), low frequency/high frequency ratio (LF/HF ratio), and standard deviation ratio from commonly used Poincare plot (SD2/SD1 ratio). Choroidal thickness was measured using OCT directly under the foveola. RESULTS: Patients and healthy controls did not differ in health and medical characteristics in addition to CSC disease. Choroidal thickness was greatest in patients with CSC (mean±SD: 342±80 ?m) compared to controls (235±60 ?m, p<0.0001). A correlation was observed between LF/HF ratio and choroidal thickness in patients with CSC (Pearson correlation 0.63, p=0.02), where the CSC group had a lower LF/HF ratio (Median 2.39 ms2, IQR: 1.2-4.34 ms2) compared to controls (Median 1.2 ms2, IQR: 0.9-2.4 ms2, p=0.06) and SD2/SD1 ratio (CSC 0.59±0.2 vs controls 0.74±0.3, p=0.06). CONCLUSION: We found a correlation between the thickness of the choroid and the HRV-measured LF/HF ratio in patients with CSC and showed a borderline significant reduction in HRV measurements in patients with CSC. The data imply that vagal alterations exist in patients with CSC. Due to the low n, this should be considered as a pilot study. Further studies are warranted to elucidate mechanisms and validate findings. © 2023 Nordsten et al.

BACKGROUND: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is associated with lower physical activity but less is known about its association with daily patterns of activity. We examined the cross-sectional association between ankle-brachial index (ABI) and objectively measured patterns of physical activity among Hispanic/Latino adults. METHODS: We analyzed data from 7,688 participants (aged 45-74 years) in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos. ABI was categorized as low (?0.90, indicating PAD), borderline low (0.91-0.99), normal (1.00-1.40), and high (>1.40, indicating incompressible ankle arteries). Daily physical activity metrics derived from accelerometer data included: log of total activity counts (LTAC), total log-transformed activity counts (TLAC), and active-to-sedentary transition probability (ASTP). Average differences between ABI categories in physical activity, overall and by 4-hour time-of-day intervals, were assessed using linear regression and mixed-effects models, respectively. RESULTS: In Hispanic/Latino adults, 5.3% and 2.6% had low and high ABIs, respectively. After adjustment, having a low compared to a normal ABI was associated with lower volume (LTAC=-0.13, p<0.01; TLAC=-74.4, p=0.04) and more fragmented physical activity (ASTP=1.22%, p<0.01). Having a low ABI was linked with more fragmented physical activity after 12PM (p<0.01). Having a high ABI was associated with lower volumes of activity (TLAC=-132.0, p=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Having a low or high ABI is associated with lower and more fragmented physical activity in Hispanic/Latino adults. In adults with low ABI, physical activity is more fragmented in the afternoon to evening. Longitudinal research is warranted to expand these findings to guide targeted interventions for PAD or incompressible ankle arteries. © The Author(s) 2023.

INTRODUCTION: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a complex mental disorder with core symptoms like interpersonal instability, emotion dysregulation, self-harm, and impulsive decision-making. Previous neuropsychological studies have found impairment in the decision-making of patients with BPD related to impulsivity. In our study, we focus on a better, more nuanced understanding of impulsive decision-making in BPD with the help of Rogers' decision-making test that simulates a gambling situation. METHODS: A novelty of our study is that we excluded from further analysis non-compliant participants based on their performance. Outlier participants on the measures proportion of good choices and average of wager choice number were filtered out to represent the population that understood the basic premise of the task and showed minimal motivation to gain rewards. Thus participants often choosing the less likely color or frequently choosing the first bet amount available (to probably speed up the test) were omitted from further analysis. Another novelty is that we assessed and reported six variables that examine Deliberation Time, Quality of Decision, Risk-taking, Overall proportion bet, Delay aversion, and Risk adjustment. Forty-three women with BPD participated in the study, and 16 non-compliant were excluded. As for the healthy control group, 42 women participated in the study, and four non-compliant were excluded. Thus, we compared the data of 27 patients with BPD with 38 healthy controls. RESULTS: Our results show that there are significant differences amongst the groups regarding the Quality of Decision Making (F (1,63)?=?5.801, p?=?0.019) and Risk Adjustment (F (1,63)?=?6.522, p?=?0.013). We also found significant interactions between group and winning probability regarding Risk Taking (F (4,252)?=?4.765 p?=?0.001) and Overall proportion of bets, i.e., the average proportion of bets relative to the total score of the subject (F (4,252)?=?4.505, p?=?0.002). DISCUSSION: Our results show that the two groups use different decision-making strategies that can have various associations with everyday life situations.

INTRODUCTION: Emotional dependence, anxious-depressive symptoms and substance use have been associated with gambling disorder (GD). Although anxiety and depression have been predominantly related to female gamblers and substance abuse to male gamblers, the role of emotional dependence in GD is unknown. Moreover, sex differences remain underexplored. OBJECTIVES: First, to explore possible differences in emotional dependence, anxious-depressive symptoms and substance abuse by group (GD and non-GD) and sex (women vs men). Second, to analyse the predictive role of emotional dependence in alcohol and drug abuse and anxious-depressive symptoms in patients with GD as a function of sex. METHODS: Instruments to measure gambling (SOGS), emotional dependence (CDE), anxious-depressive symptoms (SCL-90-R) and substance abuse (MULTICAGE CAD-4) were administered to 108 people with GD diagnosis (60 women and 48 men) and 429 without GD (342 women and 87 men). STUDY DESIGN: The research is an analytical cross-sectional study. RESULTS: The results showed that the group with GD scored significantly higher than the non-GD group on alcohol abuse, symptoms of depression and anxiety, and emotional dependence, but not on drug abuse. In the group with GD, emotional dependence predicted alcohol and drug abuse in women, and emotional dependence predicted anxiety and depressive symptoms in men. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that women with GD who consume alcohol or drugs would benefit from therapies addressing loneliness, borderline expression, attention-seeking and affective expression. Men with GD who report anxious-depressive symptomatology would benefit from therapeutic strategies to deal with separation anxiety and attention-seeking. Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

Diabetes mellitus (DM) has become the third chronic non-infectious disease affecting patients after tumor, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, becoming one of the major public health issues worldwide. Detection of early warning risk factors for DM is key to the prevention of DM, which has been the focus of some previous studies. Therefore, from the perspective of residents' self-management and prevention, this study constructed Bayesian networks (BNs) combining feature screening and multiple resampling techniques for DM monitoring data with a class imbalance in Shanxi Province, China, to detect risk factors in chronic disease monitoring programs and predict the risk of DM. First, univariate analysis and Boruta feature selection algorithm were employed to conduct the preliminary screening of all included risk factors. Then, three resampling techniques, SMOTE, Borderline-SMOTE (BL-SMOTE) and SMOTE-ENN, were adopted to deal with data imbalance. Finally, BNs developed by three algorithms (Tabu, Hill-climbing and MMHC) were constructed using the processed data to find the warning factors that strongly correlate with DM. The results showed that the accuracy of DM classification is significantly improved by the BNs constructed by processed data. In particular, the BNs combined with the SMOTE-ENN resampling improved the most, and the BNs constructed by the Tabu algorithm obtained the best classification performance compared with the hill-climbing and MMHC algorithms. The best-performing joint Boruta-SMOTE-ENN-Tabu model showed that the risk factors of DM included family history, age, central obesity, hyperlipidemia, salt reduction, occupation, heart rate, and BMI. © 2023.

There are no previous studies of the psychopathology associated with different aetiologies of chronic pruritus. A systematic review was performed of cohort and case-control studies comparing healthy controls with patients with chronic pruritus related to primary dermatoses, systemic diseases, psychogenic pruritus, idiopathic pruritus, prurigo nodularis and/or lichen simplex chronicus. The review was registered in PROSPERO and performed according to the PRISMA statement, which allowed the inclusion of 26 studies. The quality of eligible studies was assessed using the modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Most of the studies concern primary dermatoses and systemic diseases. Sleep disorders are a common comorbidity interrelated with pruritus, anxiety and depressive symptoms, in primary dermatoses. Sleep disorders are linked with pruritus and depressive symptoms in end-stage renal disease and hepatobiliary disease. Depressive and anxiety symptoms are associated with psychogenic pruritus. Psychogenic pruritus, lichen simplex chronicus and some primary dermatoses are linked with personality characteristics. Further studies are required to explore in depth the psychopathology linked with psychogenic pruritus and prurigo nodularis, as well as psychopathology linked with other primary dermatoses and systemic disorders associated with chronic pruritus, and to better differentiate psychogenic pruritus from psychopathological characteristics linked with other aetiologies of chronic pruritus, in order to improve the management of patients with chronic pruritus.

The vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 13B (VPS13B) is a large and highly conserved protein. Disruption of VPS13B causes the autosomal recessive Cohen syndrome, a rare disorder characterized by microcephaly and intellectual disability among other features, including developmental delay, hypotonia, and friendly-personality. However, the underlying mechanisms by which VPS13B disruption leads to brain dysfunction still remain unexplained. To gain insights into the neuropathogenesis of Cohen syndrome, we systematically characterized brain changes in Vps13b-mutant mice and compared murine findings to 235 previously published and 17 new patients diagnosed with VPS13B-related Cohen syndrome. We showed that Vps13b is differentially expressed across brain regions with the highest expression in the cerebellum, the hippocampus and the cortex with postnatal peak. Half of the Vps13b-/- die during the first week of life. The remaining mice have a normal lifespan and display the core phenotypes of the human disease, including microcephaly, growth delay, hypotonia, altered memory, and enhanced sociability. Systematic 2D and 3D brain histo-morphological analyses reveal specific structural changes in the brain starting after birth. The dentate gyrus is the brain region with the most prominent reduction in size, while the motor cortex is specifically thinner in layer VI. The fornix, the fasciculus retroflexus, and the cingulate cortex remain unaffected. Interestingly, these neuroanatomical changes implicate an increase of neuronal death during infantile stages with no progression in adulthood suggesting that VPS13B promotes neuronal survival early in life. Importantly, whilst both sexes were affected, some neuroanatomical and behavioral phenotypes were less pronounced or even absent in females. We evaluate sex differences in Cohen patients and conclude that females are less affected both in mice and patients. Our findings provide new insights about the neurobiology of VPS13B and highlight previously unreported brain phenotypes while defining Cohen syndrome as a likely new entity of non-progressive infantile neurodegeneration.

Electronic address: qiuj318@swu.edu.cn. BACKGROUND: Passive coping style (CS) and perceived stress play significant roles as influencing factors in the development of anxiety. However, the underlying neurobiological mechanism linking passive CS and perceived stress to anxiety susceptibility remains elusive. Thus, we aimed to investigate the relationships among passive CS, brain functional connectivity, perceived stress, and anxiety in young adults. METHODS: Data from the longitudinal Gene-Brain-Behavior Project(GBB) and Southwest University Longitudinal Imaging Multimodal Project(SLIM) were used. We confirmed the relationship among anxiety, passive CS and perceived stress. Then, we investigated the mediated functional connectivity between passive CS and perceived stress, and used these functional connections to predict present anxiety and follow-up anxiety one year later. RESULTS: Anxiety scores were significantly positively correlated with passive CS and perceived stress. At the brain network level, connections within the default mode network (DMN) and between the somatomotor network (SMN) and subcortical network (SUN) mediated the relationship between passive CS and perceived stress. Furthermore, present anxiety and follow-up anxiety one year later could be predicted by these mediated functional connections. Nodes with greater predictive contribution were mainly located in the left anterior cingulate gyrus (ACC), left inferior parietal gyrus (IPG), right superior frontal gyrus (SFG), and left middle frontal gyrus (MFG), mainly distributed on the DMN. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrated that the mediated neurobiological mechanisms between passive CS and perceived stress could be used to predict present and future anxiety, which enhance understanding of the neurobiological basis of anxiety susceptibility in this passive CS and perceived stress and may have implications for early preventing and intervening mental disorders.

Handedness is a core phenotype in clinical laterality research and several different disorders such as schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders have been linked to a higher prevalence of non-right-handedness. Moreover, subclinical personality traits like schizotypy have been linked to a higher prevalence of non-right-handedness. The association with handedness is poorly understood for generalized anxiety disorder and specific phobias, as well as for state and trait anxiety and fear of specific stimuli in nonclinical samples. Therefore, we performed a narrative review of studies investigating handedness in anxiety disorders patients and studies that compared anxiety scores between different handedness groups. Unlike schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders, there seems to be no strong association between anxiety disorders and handedness in adult patients, except for specific phobias. Studies often had small sample sizes and therefore a high risk to report spurious findings. Similar findings were reported in most non-clinical studies. Importantly, familial handedness affects phobia risk and antenatal maternal anxiety increased the probability of mixed-handedness. This suggests that a transgenerational, developmental perspective is essential to better understand the complex interrelations between handedness and anxiety. Familial and especially maternal handedness and anxiety disorders should be integrated into future studies on handedness and anxiety whenever possible.

BACKGROUND: Assessment of personality functioning in different stages of psychotic disorders could provide valuable information on psychopathology, course of illness and treatment planning, but empirical data are sparse. AIMS: To investigate personality functioning and sense of self in individuals at ultra-high risk (UHR) for psychosis and with first-episode psychosis (FEP) in comparison with a clinical control group of individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD) and healthy controls. METHOD: In a cross-sectional design, we investigated personality functioning (Structured Interview of Personality Organization, STIPO; Level of Personality Functioning Scale, LPFS) and disturbances of the basic self (Examination of Anomalous Self-Experience, EASE) in 107 participants, comprising 24 individuals at UHR, 29 individuals with FEP, 27 individuals with BPD and 27 healthy controls. RESULTS: The UHR, FEP and BPD groups had moderate to severe deficits in personality organisation (STIPO) compared with the healthy control group. Self-functioning with its subdomain (facet) 'self-direction' (LPFS) was significantly worse in participants with manifest psychosis (FEP) compared with those at-risk for psychosis (UHR). The FEP group showed significantly worse overall personality functioning than the UHR group and significantly higher levels of self-disturbance (EASE) than the BPD group, with the UHR group lying between these diagnostic groups. Hierarchical cluster analysis based on the seven STIPO domains yielded three clusters differing in level of personality functioning and self-disturbances. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that psychotic disorders are associated with impaired personality functioning and self-disturbances. Assessment of personality functioning can inform treatment planning for patients at different stages of psychotic disorder. DOI: 10.1192/bjo.2023.530 PMID: 37563768  34.

People often form polarized beliefs, imbuing objects (e.g., themselves or others) with unambiguously positive or negative qualities. In clinical settings, this is referred to as dichotomous thinking or ""splitting"" and is a feature of several psychiatric disorders. Here, we introduce a Bayesian model of splitting that parameterizes a tendency to rigidly categorize objects as either entirely ""Bad"" or ""Good,"" rather than to flexibly learn dispositions along a continuous scale. Distinct from the previous descriptive theories, the model makes quantitative predictions about how dichotomous beliefs emerge and are updated in light of new information. Specifically, the model addresses how splitting is context-dependent, yet exhibits stability across time. A key model feature is that phases of devaluation and/or idealization are consolidated by rationally attributing counter-evidence to external factors. For example, when another person is idealized, their less-than-perfect behavior is attributed to unfavorable external circumstances. However, sufficient counter-evidence can trigger switches of polarity, producing bistable dynamics. We show that the model can be fitted to empirical data, to measure individual susceptibility to relational instability. For example, we find that a latent categorical belief that others are ""Good"" accounts for less changeable, and more certain, character impressions of benevolent as opposed to malevolent others among healthy participants. By comparison, character impressions made by participants with borderline personality disorder reveal significantly higher and more symmetric splitting. The generative framework proposed invites applications for modeling oscillatory relational and affective dynamics in psychotherapeutic contexts.

OBJECTIVE: Negative urgency (NU) and distress tolerance (DT) are two similar yet distinct constructs with putative transdiagnostic relevance, particularly across psychopathology characterized by impulsivity (e.g., substance use disorders [SUD], eating disorders featuring binging and/or purging ED-B/P, and borderline personality disorder [BPD]). Yet, there remains a lack of research into NU and DT across SUD, ED-B/P, and BPD symptomatology in clinical populations. The present study sought to elucidate the transdiagnostic utility of NU and DT across impulsive-type psychology by examining the unique and interactive roles of NU and DT across SUD, ED-B/P, and BPD symptomatology within a treatment-seeking sample of young people. METHOD: Participants (N?=?385; 62.3% female; aged 16-25 years) were recruited from youth health services across Melbourne, Australia. Participants completed an online survey including self-report measures of NU and DT as well as SUD, ED-B/P, and BPD symptoms. Mixed effects logistic regression was used to explore unique and interactive associations of NU and DT with symptoms. RESULTS: Both NU (adjusted odds ratio [ORadj ]?=?1.22; 95% confidence interval [CI]?=?[1.16, 1.28]) and global DT (ORadj ?=?0.59; 95% CI?=?[0.47, 0.74]) uniquely predicted symptoms. However, associations with global DT and most of its components differed across psychopathology types. No significant interactions between NU and DT in predicting symptoms were found. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the transdiagnostic utility of NU across SUD, ED-B/P, and BPD, while suggesting the role of DT across these disorders is more nuanced. These findings have important implications for NU and DT as potential intervention targets. © 2023 The Authors. Journal of Clinical Psychology published by Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Previous research demonstrates that parents' communication skills may contribute to the development and maintenance of their young person's borderline personality disorder (BPD). Carers of people with BPD also experience their own psychosocial stressors and feel unsupported. Consequently, Dialectical Behavior Therapy for adolescents (DBT-A) invites parents to partake in group therapy alongside their young person. Despite this involvement, little research exists examining parents' perspective of engaging in a DBT-A program, and specifically whether they experience their own benefits and changes from being part of the program. To examine this, the current study interviews 34 parents who engaged in an early intervention DBT-A program. Thematic analysis resulted in seven key themes and 16 subthemes beginning with parents' expectations of the program, followed by the key elements of the program that facilitated change, and the actual changes and benefits attributed to these elements. Overall, parents were surprised by their own gains from the program, and how the skills they learned facilitated personal development that improved family communication and functioning with their young person and more broadly. This study addresses the gap in understanding the parent perspective with clinical implications for the benefits of involving parents in therapy more generally. © 2023 The Authors.

BACKGROUND: Sex differences in the prevalence and clinical features of depression have been widely described. However, some authors argue that categorical diagnostic systems do not adequately capture the complexity of depression. The aim of this study was to examine sex differences in the symptom network structure of depressive symptoms among individuals with a major depressive episode. METHODS: The study sample consisted of 510 participants (age 62.17 ± 14.43, 71.96 % women) from a nationwide study of the Spanish non-institutionalised adult population (Edad con Salud). To estimate the presence of a 12-month major depressive episode according to DSM-IV criteria, participants were administered an adapted version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI 3.0). A network analysis was carried out to determine possible interrelationships between different depressive symptoms by sex. RESULTS: Men and women showed a similar overall structure and network strength. However, sex-specific variations emerged in relation to individual symptom associations and symptom centrality. Specifically, for individual symptom associations ""loss of confidence"" and ""suicide attempts"" were more strongly related in women, and ""suicidal ideation"" and ""impaired thinking"" in men. For symptom centrality, ""anxiety"" played a central role in men's symptomatology, whereas ""hopelessness"", ""loss of confidence"", ""distress"" and ""slowness of movement"" were the most central symptoms in the women's group. LIMITATIONS: Reliance on cross-sectional data precludes us from determining the direction and temporality of the association between different symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that specific symptoms should be prioritised in the prevention, diagnosis assessment and treatment of depressed patients based on sex. Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

BACKGROUND: Borderline personality disorder is a common and treatable personality disorder that is often underdiagnosed and untreated, mainly due to a lack of training of psychiatrists and to a lack of accessibility to specialized therapies. However, no study has been conducted in France regarding this issue. Thus, we aimed to evaluate on a national scale the level of training, knowledge, and general attitude toward BPD diagnosis of French psychiatrists. METHODS: We conducted an online survey in an unselected population of residents and senior French psychiatrists between January and March 2022, the results of which are presented descriptively. RESULTS: 228 psychiatrists fully answered the questionnaire, and 21 more psychiatrists answered it partially. We found that most of the responders were unsatisfied with the residency training or the continuing medical education offered regarding BPD, a lack of training resulting in a low level of self-confidence regarding BPD management, in a low number of evidence-based therapies trained psychiatrists in issues regarding diagnostic disclosure, and in misconceptions regarding some aspects of the disorder. CONCLUSIONS: These results underlie a clear lack of training of French psychiatrists, as well as a request from the latter for more opportunities to learn. This calls for a rethinking of the teaching system to incorporate more knowledge and tools related to BPD. Copyright © 2023 L'Encéphale, Paris. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

BACKGROUND: Anxiety and depression are among the greatest contributors to the global burden of diseases. The close associations of personality traits with anxiety and depression have been widely described. However, the common practice of sum scores in previous studies limits the understanding of the fine-grained connections between different personality traits and anxiety and depression symptoms and cannot explore and compare the risk or protective effects of personality traits on anxiety and depression symptoms. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the fine-grained connections between different personality traits and anxiety and depression symptoms and identify the detrimental or protective effects of different personality traits on anxiety and depression symptoms. METHODS: A total of 536 college students from China were recruited online, and the average age was 19.98?±?1.11. The Chinese version of the Ten-Item Personality Inventory, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 was used to investigate the personality traits and symptoms of anxiety and depression of participants after they understood the purpose and filling method of the survey and signed the informed consent. The demographic characteristics were summarized, and the scale scores were calculated. The network model of personality traits and symptoms of anxiety and depression was constructed, and bridge expected influence (BEI) was measured to evaluate the effect of personality traits on anxiety and depression. The edge accuracy and BEI stability were estimated, and the BEI difference and the edge weight difference were tested. RESULTS: In the network, 29 edges (indicating partial correlations between variables) bridged the personality community and the anxiety and depression community, among which the strongest correlations were extraversion-fatigue, agreeableness-suicidal ideation, conscientiousness-uncontrollable worry, neuroticism-excessive worry, neuroticism-irritability, and openness-feelings of worthlessness. Neuroticism had the highest positive BEI value (0.32), agreeableness had the highest negative BEI value (-0.27), and the BEI values of neuroticism and agreeableness were significantly different from those of most other nodes (p?<?0.05). CONCLUSION: There are intricate correlations between personality traits and the symptoms of anxiety and depression in college students. Neuroticism was identified as the most crucial risk trait for depression and anxiety symptoms, while agreeableness was the most central protective trait. Copyright © 2023 Yang, Guo, Zhu, Liu and Guo.

Contrary to the law of less work, individuals with high levels of need for cognition and self-control tend to choose harder tasks more often. While both traits can be integrated into a core construct of dispositional cognitive effort investment, its relation to actual cognitive effort investment remains unclear. As individuals with high levels of cognitive effort investment are characterized by a high intrinsic motivation towards effortful cognition, they would be less likely to increase their effort based on expected payoff, but rather based on increasing demand. In the present study, we measured actual effort investment on multiple dimensions, i.e., subjective load, reaction time, accuracy, early and late frontal midline theta power, N2 and P3 amplitude, and pupil dilation. In a sample of N = 148 participants, we examined the relationship of dispositional cognitive effort investment and effort indices during a flanker and an n-back task with varying demand and payoff. Exploratorily, we examined this relationship for the two subdimensions cognitive motivation and effortful-self-control as well. In both tasks, effort indices were sensitive to demand and partly to payoff. The analyses revealed a main effect of cognitive effort investment for accuracy (n-back task), interaction effects with payoff for reaction time (n-back and flanker task) and P3 amplitude (n-back task) and demand for early frontal midline theta power (flanker task). Taken together, our results partly support the notion that individuals with high levels of cognitive effort investment exert effort more efficiently. Moreover, the notion that these individuals exert effort regardless of payoff is partly supported, too. This may further our understanding of the conditions under which person-situation interactions occur, i.e. the conditions under which situations determine effort investment in goal-directed behavior more than personality, and vice versa.

BACKGROUND: Although a surge of interest has recently emerged in investigating the simultaneous problematic use of various technology-based tools, the findings are still inconclusive. The present web-based survey aimed at examining whether (a) personality traits, coping strategies, and sociodemographics are associated with problematic internet, smartphone, and SMS use among Greek users and (b) personality traits mediate the relationship between maladaptive coping strategies and problematic use of the three media. STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. METHODS: A convenience and snowball sample of 1016 participants (84.4% female, mean age of 30.3 years) completed the Problematic Internet Use Questionnaire-9 (PIUQ-9), the Mobile Phone Problem Use Scale (MPPUS), the Self-Perception of Text Message Dependency Scale (STDS), the Personality Diagnostic Questionnaire 4+(PDQ-4+), and the Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced Inventory (Brief COPE). RESULTS: Shared predictors between problematic use of the three technology-based tools were younger age and low educational level, the coping strategy of substance use, and the narcissistic, avoidant, and dependent personality disorders. Predictors of problematic internet and smartphone use were coping strategies of emotional support, self-distraction, and behavioral disengagement. According to structural equation models (SEM) models, cluster C personality disorders fully mediate the relationship between maladaptive coping strategies and problematic use of technology-based tools. CONCLUSION: Addressing factors that predispose (i.e., personality traits), precipitate, or maintain problematic use (i.e., coping strategies) can lead to effective and cost-saving preventive (i.e., screening of vulnerable groups) and therapeutic efforts (i.e., teaching adaptive coping strategies). © 2022 The Author(s); Published by Hamadan University of Medical Sciences.

People often form polarized beliefs, imbuing objects (e.g., themselves or others) with unambiguously positive or negative qualities. In clinical settings, this is referred to as dichotomous thinking or ""splitting"" and is a feature of several psychiatric disorders. Here, we introduce a Bayesian model of splitting that parameterizes a tendency to rigidly categorize objects as either entirely ""Bad"" or ""Good,"" rather than to flexibly learn dispositions along a continuous scale. Distinct from the previous descriptive theories, the model makes quantitative predictions about how dichotomous beliefs emerge and are updated in light of new information. Specifically, the model addresses how splitting is context-dependent, yet exhibits stability across time. A key model feature is that phases of devaluation and/or idealization are consolidated by rationally attributing counter-evidence to external factors. For example, when another person is idealized, their less-than-perfect behavior is attributed to unfavorable external circumstances. However, sufficient counter-evidence can trigger switches of polarity, producing bistable dynamics. We show that the model can be fitted to empirical data, to measure individual susceptibility to relational instability. For example, we find that a latent categorical belief that others are ""Good"" accounts for less changeable, and more certain, character impressions of benevolent as opposed to malevolent others among healthy participants. By comparison, character impressions made by participants with borderline personality disorder reveal significantly higher and more symmetric splitting. The generative framework proposed invites applications for modeling oscillatory relational and affective dynamics in psychotherapeutic contexts.

The aim of our study was to compare typical Thai and Hungarian personality profiles of the Zuckerman-Kuhlman-Aluja Personality Questionnaire (ZKA-PQ). 672 Thai and 647 Hungarian were included in our study. The distribution of age, gender and education level were matched. The ZKA-PQ was administered that measures Aggression, Extraversion, Activity, Sensation Seeking and Neuroticism. We tested reliability, the structural invariance and analyzed aggregated mean profiles for cultures as well as typical profiles by cluster analyses. Reliability of factors were acceptable in both cultures, but some facets (especially AC3 Restlessness) showed low reliability. The global Tucker's coefficient of congruence (TCC) for cross-cultural factorial invariance was 95. We have also run a Multigroup Confirmatory Factor Analysis, but fit indices were not adequate. Cross-cultural neural network invariance was not met either. Hungarians scored significantly higher on Extraversion, Sensation Seeking, Aggression and Activity. Cluster-analyses revealed six typical profiles: Introverted impulsive, Reserved, Resilients, Overcontrolled, Aggressive impulsive and Positive sensation seeker. Majority of first two clusters were Thai respondents, majority for last two clusters were Hungarians. In sum, there were some cross-cultural congruence in factor structure, but strict invariance was not fulfilled. Comparison of mean profiles remain tentative, but cluster analysis revealed cross-cultural differences in typical profiles. © 2023. Springer Nature Limited.

BACKGROUND: A negative response towards a current pregnancy consists of two elements: unwantedness of and unhappiness about the current pregnancy. Little is clear about whether pregnant women can be categorized in terms of unwantedness and unhappiness as well as what the correlates are of these categories. METHODS: An internet survey of 696 women in their first trimester of pregnancy examined the participants' intention of and emotional reaction towards pregnancy, borderline personality traits, adult attachment style, depression, fear of childbirth, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, fetal bonding disorder, avoidance of taking part in child care, and consideration about termination of pregnancy (TOP). About one third of the participants were followed up with in their second trimester. RESULTS: Two-step cluster analysis using the participants' intention of and emotional reaction towards pregnancy revealed three groups of pregnant women: those who wanted and were happy about the pregnancy (Cluster 1), those who were unhappy about the pregnancy (Cluster 2), and those who did not intend to be pregnant but were happy about pregnancy (Cluster 3). Cluster 2 women, but not Cluster 3 women, were likely to be single, with borderline personality traits as well as unstable adult attachment styles, accompanied by depression, fear of childbirth, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and fetal bonding disorder. They were more likely to avoid caring for the baby after childbirth and consider TOP. CONCLUSION: Expectant women who were unhappy about their pregnancy were at risk of psychological adjustment and need specific perinatal mental health assessment and care.

Competing models suggest that physical pain may play an important role in nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) via pain onset or pain offset, or that pain may be absent (analgesia). Few studies have tested these models in the same sample or examined factors that could explain differences in NSSI pain experience. We assessed 1,630 individuals with NSSI histories in an online survey. We descriptively examined pain during NSSI and tested preregistered hypotheses that NSSI frequency, NSSI severity, borderline personality disorder (BPD) features, emotional pain, and dissociation during NSSI are associated with experiencing less NSSI pain. Exploratorily, we also tested whether self-punishment motives were associated with less NSSI pain. Almost all participants reported recent and frequent NSSI. Participants were heterogenous in their report of NSSI pain. We found minimal support for analgesia (reported by only 4.3% of participants). More participants reported pain onset than offset, but offset was associated with reductions in emotional pain. Emotional pain was elevated prior to NSSI and decreased significantly during and after NSSI. We found that higher dissociation during NSSI was associated with less NSSI pain. Contrary to hypotheses, NSSI severity, emotional pain prior to NSSI, and self-punishment motives were associated with greater NSSI pain. NSSI frequency and BPD features were not associated with NSSI pain. BPD features interacted with dissociation and emotional pain prior to NSSI. Findings contrast with laboratory pain induction work, suggesting that, though people who self-harm may have heightened pain tolerance, they may seek to self-injure in a manner that results in pain.

The aim of this study was to investigate the functional connectivity (FC) of BPD in adolescents, and to explore the relationship between FC changes and executive function in adolescents with BPD. 50 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years with BPD and 21 gender-and-age matched healthy controls (HC) were enrolled into the study. Brain MRI scan including a 3D-T1 weighted structural sequence and a resting-state fMRI was acquired. A seed-based FC analysis was performed. We used the Stroop color-word test (SCWT) and the trail making test (TMT) to evaluate the executive function of the participants. Correlative analysis of FC alterations with executive function and clinical symptoms was also performed. Compared to the HCs, adolescents with BPD showed increased FC in the limbic-cortical circuit, such as the FC between the left hippocampus and right parahippocampal gyrus, between the right middle occipital gyrus and the left middle temporal gyrus, and between the left medial superior frontal gyrus and the right inferior temporal gyrus. FC in the default mode network (DMN) was decreased between the left angular gyrus and the left precuneus but increased between the left angular gyrus and the right anterior cingulate cortex (voxel P?<?0.001, cluster P?<?0.05, FWE corrected). The BPD group demonstrated significantly lower cognitive testing scores than the HC group on the SCWT-A (P?<?0.001), SCWT-B (P?<?0.001), and SCWT-C (P?=?0.034). The FC alterations between limbic system and cortical regions were associated with SCWT and TMT (P?<?0.05). FC alterations were noted in both limbic-cortical circuit and DMN in adolescents with BPD, which were associated with impaired executive function. This study implicated the FC alterations as the neural correlates of executive functioning in adolescents with BPD. © 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

OBJECTIVE: Previous evidence indicates that scales from the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) family of instruments can measure self-reported posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomology and differentiate symptom clusters, including in forensic disability assessments. However, limited research has examined assessment of PTSD symptoms with the MMPI-3, the most recent MMPI instrument. The goal of the current study was to identify the strongest MMPI-3 scale predictors of individual PTSD symptom clusters, measured via self-report. METHODS: Using a sample of 716 disability claimants (54.2% men; Mage ?=?42.98, SD?=?10.87; 81.8% White), correlation, regression, and dominance analyses were performed to examine associations between scores on MMPI-3 scales and latent PTSD symptom cluster factors derived using confirmatory factor analyses from items of the Detailed Assessment of Posttraumatic Stress (DAPS), and to identify the strongest predictor of each symptom cluster when MMPI-3 scales were concurrently considered. RESULTS: Results indicate that conceptually expected MMPI-3 scale scores were meaningfully associated with PTSD symptom cluster factors, with the MMPI-3 Anxiety-Related Experiences (ARX) scale demonstrating the strongest and most consistent associations across symptom clusters. CONCLUSIONS: Results of the current study largely converge with previous empirical studies of self-reported PTSD symptoms in disability claimant settings with the MMPI instruments. Interpretive implications for the MMPI-3, limitations, and future research directions are discussed. © 2023 The Authors. Journal of Clinical Psychology published by Wiley Periodicals LLC.

BACKGROUND: Although a surge of interest has recently emerged in investigating the simultaneous problematic use of various technology-based tools, the findings are still inconclusive. The present web-based survey aimed at examining whether (a) personality traits, coping strategies, and sociodemographics are associated with problematic internet, smartphone, and SMS use among Greek users and (b) personality traits mediate the relationship between maladaptive coping strategies and problematic use of the three media. STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. METHODS: A convenience and snowball sample of 1016 participants (84.4% female, mean age of 30.3 years) completed the Problematic Internet Use Questionnaire-9 (PIUQ-9), the Mobile Phone Problem Use Scale (MPPUS), the Self-Perception of Text Message Dependency Scale (STDS), the Personality Diagnostic Questionnaire 4+(PDQ-4+), and the Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced Inventory (Brief COPE). RESULTS: Shared predictors between problematic use of the three technology-based tools were younger age and low educational level, the coping strategy of substance use, and the narcissistic, avoidant, and dependent personality disorders. Predictors of problematic internet and smartphone use were coping strategies of emotional support, self-distraction, and behavioral disengagement. According to structural equation models (SEM) models, cluster C personality disorders fully mediate the relationship between maladaptive coping strategies and problematic use of technology-based tools. CONCLUSION: Addressing factors that predispose (i.e., personality traits), precipitate, or maintain problematic use (i.e., coping strategies) can lead to effective and cost-saving preventive (i.e., screening of vulnerable groups) and therapeutic efforts (i.e., teaching adaptive coping strategies). © 2022 The Author(s); Published by Hamadan University of Medical Sciences.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to explore whether serum CXCL8 concentration can be used as a noninvasive marker of subclinical rejection (SCR) after pediatric liver transplantation (pLT). METHODS: Firstly, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed on 22 protocol liver biopsy samples. Secondly, several experimental methods were used to verify the RNA-seq results. Finally, the clinical data and serum samples of 520 LT patients in the Department of Pediatric Transplantation of Tianjin First Central Hospital from January 2018 to December 2019 were collected. RESULTS: RNA-seq results indicated that CXCL8 was significantly increased in the SCR group. The results of the 3 experimental methods were consistent with RNA-seq results. According to the 1:2 propensity score matching, 138 patients were divided into the SCR (n?=?46) and non-SCR (n?=?92) groups. Serological test results indicated that there was no difference in preoperative CXCL8 concentration between the SCR and non-SCR groups ( P ?>?0.05). However, during protocol biopsy, CXCL8 in the SCR group was significantly higher than in the non-SCR group ( P ?<?0.001). In diagnosing SCR, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the area under the curve of CXCL8 was 0.966 (95% confidence interval, 0.938-0.995), sensitivity was 95%, and specificity was 94.6%. In differentiating nonborderline from borderline rejection, the area under the curve of CXCL8 was 0.853 (95% confidence interval, 0.718-0.988), sensitivity was 86.7%, and specificity was 94.6%. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that serum CXCL8 concentration has high accuracy for the diagnosis and disease stratification of SCR after pLT. Copyright © 2023 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

BACKGROUND: Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) is a prevalent autoimmune disease of thyroid gland with a shared immunological mechanism with mood disorders. Affective temperament (AT) is a biologically determined personality trait that has been linked to mood disorders. The aim of this study was to examine the association between dominant AT and levels of psychosomatic symptoms in women newly diagnosed with HT in comparison to clinically healthy subjects. METHODS: The observational cross-sectional study with nested case control study was involving 146 consecutive participants, who were divided into three groups. The two study groups consisted of women with HT (73), including 49 with hypothyroid HT and 24 with euthyroid HT, and the third group was a control group of healthy participants (73). The Serbian version of the TEMPS-A was utilized to assess AT, while the 4DSQ was used to measure psychosomatic symptoms. RESULTS: The results showed that hyperthymic AT was dominant in all examined groups. The groups with HT differed from the control group in terms of depressive and cyclothymic AT. Furthermore, the study found higher levels of psychosomatic symptoms in the group with HT compared to the control group, with significant differences in distress (p = 0.005) and somatization (p = 0.023) levels. All AT was associated with levels of psychosomatic symptoms in subjects with hypothyroid HT. In contrast, in subjects with euthyroid HT, the association was only found between depressive and cyclothymic AT with distress and depression levels, as well as between somatization and cyclothymic AT. No association was found between AT and anxiety levels in subjects with euthyroid HT. CONCLUSION: The research found differences between study groups in the association between AT and levels of psychosomatic symptoms. Further research with a larger sample size is necessary to more clearly define the associations between affective temperaments and psychosomatic symptoms in women with euthyroid and hypothyroid HT.

The aim of our study was to compare typical Thai and Hungarian personality profiles of the Zuckerman-Kuhlman-Aluja Personality Questionnaire (ZKA-PQ). 672 Thai and 647 Hungarian were included in our study. The distribution of age, gender and education level were matched. The ZKA-PQ was administered that measures Aggression, Extraversion, Activity, Sensation Seeking and Neuroticism. We tested reliability, the structural invariance and analyzed aggregated mean profiles for cultures as well as typical profiles by cluster analyses. Reliability of factors were acceptable in both cultures, but some facets (especially AC3 Restlessness) showed low reliability. The global Tucker's coefficient of congruence (TCC) for cross-cultural factorial invariance was 95. We have also run a Multigroup Confirmatory Factor Analysis, but fit indices were not adequate. Cross-cultural neural network invariance was not met either. Hungarians scored significantly higher on Extraversion, Sensation Seeking, Aggression and Activity. Cluster-analyses revealed six typical profiles: Introverted impulsive, Reserved, Resilients, Overcontrolled, Aggressive impulsive and Positive sensation seeker. Majority of first two clusters were Thai respondents, majority for last two clusters were Hungarians. In sum, there were some cross-cultural congruence in factor structure, but strict invariance was not fulfilled. Comparison of mean profiles remain tentative, but cluster analysis revealed cross-cultural differences in typical profiles. © 2023. Springer Nature Limited.
